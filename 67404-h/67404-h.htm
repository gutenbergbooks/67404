<p>“Halt! who comes there?”</p>

<p>Time: Daybreak on the morning of May
6th, 1864.</p>

<p>Scene: A wild, broken area of country
in northern Georgia.</p>

<p>Actors: In the foreground, a horseman
and a drowsy sentinel roused to a sense
of his duty by the sound of the approaching
rider; in the background, a score or
more of Confederate cavalry&mdash;men springing
from their blankets at the warning
of danger.</p>

<p>A rifle had sprung to the shoulder of
the startled sentry, and the sharp click
of a lock followed his ringing challenge.</p>

<p>The foam-flecked steed of the on-comer
was hurled back upon its haunches by
the iron hold laid upon its bit.</p>

<p>“Who comes there?” repeated the
ominous tone of the man in gray.</p>

<p>“A friend to the loyal,” answered the
horseman.</p>

<p>“Advance, friend, and give the countersign.”</p>

<p>“Freedom!”</p>

<p>As the single word left the stranger’s
lips, he plunged the rowels deep into his
horse’s quivering flank, when like an arrow
shot from a bow he bounded forward.</p>

<p>The movement was so sudden that before
the surprised sentry could discharge
his weapon the rider was upon him.</p>

<p>The report of his rifle followed, but
the bullet flew wide of its mark, and he
was hurled to the earth.</p>

<p>“On, Wildbird, on!” cried the reckless
rider, his words drowned by the sounds
of his flying steed’s iron heel.</p>

<p>The amazed cavalrymen had gained
their feet.</p>

<p>“Stop him, boys!” cried their leader.
“’Tis one of Sherman’s scouts!”</p>

<p>The valley was narrow here.</p>

<p>Upon the right, looking south, rose
abruptly the rugged heights.</p>

<p>On the left, a spur of the mountain
range had a more gradual ascent.</p>

<p>The escaping horseman was forced to
pause within a short distance of his enemies&mdash;so
near in fact that his white face
shone plainly in the starlight.</p>

<p>“Fire!” rang out the cavalry chief’s
wild command.</p>

<p>A volley of bullets whistled around the
fugitive’s head.</p>

<p>He was seen to reel in his saddle, but
his flight was unchecked.</p>

<p>“S’ death! there he goes!” exclaimed
the Confederate leader. “Quick! follow
me!”</p>

<p>As one the twenty men sprang forward
to intercept the fugitive’s flight.</p>

<p>Owing to a curve in the valley the
horseman could not pursue a straight
course.</p>

<p>Thus at the moment when his escape
seemed certain he found his retreat cut
off.</p>

<p>He was hemmed in.</p>

<p>As yet he had not fired a shot.</p>

<p>His assailants were now so close upon
him that his rifle was useless save as a
club.</p>

<p>If he realized his hopeless situation he
did not hesitate in his headlong course.</p>

<p>“On, Wildbird, on!”</p>

<p>Like a Centaur he swept into the midst
of his foes.</p>

<p>Some were hurled right and left.</p>

<p>The foremost seized the bridle of the
plunging horse.</p>

<p>“<a id="BRef_2" href="#Ref_2">Hold up there, you Yankee devil!</a>”</p>

<p>“Never!” rang out the sharp retort,
and the other was felled to the earth.</p>

<p>“On, Wildbird, on!”</p>

<p>The path was blocked.</p>

<p>In vain the noble brute struggled to
free himself.</p>

<p>Three of the sentinels were clinging to
its bridle and the plunging steed was
stopped.</p>

<p>Others of the assailants were trying to
pull the rider from his seat.</p>

<p>A few shots were fired, but the fight
had come to such close quarters that firearms
were of little use.</p>

<p>The stranger’s rifle had been hurled
from his grasp.</p>

<p>He felt himself borne down, and for a
moment his struggles ceased.</p>

<p>“Will you surrender?” gritted the
leader.</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“On, Wildbird, on!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a herculean effort, the
horseman freed his right arm.</p>

<p>An instant later a knife flashed in his
hand.</p>

<p>Descrying a circle in the air it descended
with lightning-like rapidity, severing at a
single stroke the horse’s bridle.</p>

<p>At the same time the assailants staggered
back, leaving the wounded and
maddened steed free.</p>

<p>With a snort of defiance it bounded
forward sending the baffled men right
and left.</p>

<p>Before they could rally, the dashing
scout had cleared them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[3]</span></p>

<p>A few shots were fired, but none seemed
to take effect.</p>

<p>As their yells of rage rang on the air,
the fugitive disappeared down the valley.</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty go!” muttered the
leader of the discomfited gang. “I should
rather have lost my right arm than that
he should have escaped.”</p>

<p>“Did you recognize him, captain?”
asked a tall, flaxened-hair soldier.</p>

<p>“He is Cavalry Curt.”</p>

<p>“Not Phil Kearney’s scout?”</p>

<p>“The same. I heard at headquarters
yesterday that he was in these regions.
His presence means us mischief.”</p>

<p>“And his escape something worse.”</p>

<p>“But he must not escape.”</p>

<p>“Quick, into the saddle. We must follow
him.”</p>

<p>Three of the party were injured so that
they could not join in the pursuit, and
were forced to remain behind.</p>

<p>The others vaulted into the saddle and
a few minutes later were following as
rapidly as the country would permit on
the trail of the fugitive.</p>

<p>He had only a slight start of them and
they felt confident of quickly overtaking
and capturing him.</p>

<p>In the very heart of the enemy’s
country his escape indeed seemed impossible.</p>

<p>“Look, Mara! Do my old eyes deceive
me, or is that a horseman?”</p>

<p>“Where, grandpa?”</p>

<p>“Crossing the ridge yonder.”</p>

<p>They presented a striking picture&mdash;one
bowed beneath the weight of four-score
years, his countenance shrunken
and wrinkled, his long, thin lock glistening
in the sunlight with the frosts of
time; the other just budding into womanhood,
fair as a poet’s dream, with hair
that vied with the gold of the sun and
eyes of a heavenly blue.</p>

<p>She was leaning gently on the arm of
her aged companion as they stood in the
doorway of their southern home, gazing
upon the surrounding landscape, until
his eye had caught sight of an object in
the distance which had startled the foregoing
dialogue.</p>

<p>“I see him, grandpa!” she exclaimed,
as her gaze followed the direction he
pointed out.</p>

<p>“He seems to be coming this way, Mara.
Who can it be?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell, grandpa. Oh, in these
terrible times I tremble lest every comer
be a foe.”</p>

<p>“Nay, child; I think we have nothing
to fear. Ah, he heads more to the south.
He is not coming here.”</p>

<p>The maiden drew a breath of relief,
and as the strange rider disappeared from
sight a minute later, she said:</p>

<p>“He is gone. I am so glad, too. But,
grandpa, have you forgotten that you
were to go to Hammond’s for me? You
will have to start at once, while I shall
have to look after my work.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Mara, my child. But hark!
Dinah is calling for you now. I never
saw such a troublesome nigger.”</p>

<p>With the words he went into the house,
leaving her still standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>She was about to follow her grandparent,
when a moving object in the distance
caught her gaze.</p>

<p>It looked like a man moving at the top
of his speed.</p>

<p>“Who can it be?” she said, speaking
aloud. “He is coming this way, too.”</p>

<p>Not a little surprised and anxious she
continued to watch and wait.</p>

<p>“It must be the horseman grandpa
and I saw on the ridge,” she mused.
“And he is certainly coming here. I
suppose I ought to rouse the folks, but
little good that will do. Poor old grandpa
is our only protection.”</p>

<p>The approach of the stranger was no
longer a matter of doubt.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was within plain
view.</p>

<p>The maiden saw that he was young&mdash;not
more than twenty-one or twenty-two.
He was handsome, too. Quite tall, broad-shouldered
and with a countenance that
Apollo might have envied.</p>

<p>But there was a haggard look upon his
face, and he carried his left arm in a
sling. His step, too, seemed uneasy and
she saw that he had gone about as far as
nature would permit him.</p>

<p>“A northern man&mdash;an accursed Yankee!”
she exclaimed under her breath, somewhat
fiercely.</p>

<p>No one else had appeared in sight as
far as she could see.</p>

<p>“Help, fair lady!” cried the wounded
stranger, when he had come within a
short distance. “I can go no further!”</p>

<p>She quickly sprang to his side and
kindly lent her aid to his falling strength.</p>

<p>With her assistance he reached the
doorway, where he sank upon the threshold
pale and faint.</p>

<p>“Let me get you a glass of wine,” she
said, disappearing into the house.</p>

<p>Gone but a minute, she placed the
cordial to his lips, when he drank a strong
draught.</p>

<p>Revived by its potent power he started
up to look wildly around.</p>

<p>“Do you see them?” he asked, huskily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<p>“Who?” she questioned in surprise.</p>

<p>“A body of horsemen. I had a narrow
escape from them. My horse was shot
and after running until nearly exhausted
I saw your house. I had barely strength
to get here. I trust you will befriend
me,” and his dark eyes were turned
toward her in pleading more eloquent
than words.</p>

<p>Her eyes fell before his gaze.</p>

<p>“You are a Yankee!” she exclaimed in
confusion.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered frankly. “I am
one of Sherman’s scouts.”</p>

<p>A shadow fell upon her fair countenance.</p>

<p>“We are rebels, here!” she faltered. “I
have a brother in Johnston’s army.”</p>

<p>It was his turn to look dismayed.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, I could go no further.
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind; you seem like an honest
man, though one of Abe Lincoln’s hirelings.
You can rest here until you regain
your strength.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I will not stop long, for
it would not be well for you to have them
find me here.”</p>

<p>“They may not come this way. Do you
know whose command it was?”</p>

<p>“It was led by Captain Dermot.”</p>

<p>She turned pale as he uttered the
name.</p>

<p>“He is a bad man. But you are
wounded. Forgive me for not thinking
of it before.”</p>

<p>“I do not think it is anything serious.
I bandaged it so as to stop somewhat the
flow of blood. It is nothing,” and he
smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“But I must insist upon seeing that it
is properly cared for with your permission.
I am quite a surgeon.”</p>

<p>“Your countenance seems very familiar
to me, but it can’t be that we have met
before.”</p>

<p>“No; our name is Morland.”</p>

<p>“Morland!” he repeated, excitedly.
“Then you are Mara Morland?”</p>

<p>She started with wonder as he mentioned
her name.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” he hastened to say,
“but I have recognized you from your
portrait which I have seen many times.
You have a brother Harry.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but he is in the army now.”</p>

<p>“He and I were chums at college.”</p>

<p>“And you are Curtis Remington?”</p>

<p>“The same. This is a glad surprise
to me. I little dreamed of meeting you.”</p>

<p>“I wish that Harry were here. He
used to speak of you often, and he told
me how you once saved his life. It seems
like meeting an old friend.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. So Harry is in the army.
I have not heard from him since we left
college. The war broke out soon after
and I enlisted at once.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad when this cruel war is
over,” she exclaimed with a shudder.
“But look! there is a body of horsemen
coming this way!”</p>

<p>“It is Captain Dermot’s company!”
declared Curtis Remington. “Can it be
possible they have tracked me here?”</p>

<p>“They are coming directly this way.
They are riding fast, too.”</p>

<p>“Then I must leave you at once.
Many thanks for your kindness. Ah,”
he added, suppressing a groan as he
staggered to his feet, “my race is almost
run.”</p>

<p>“You cannot&mdash;you must not go!” she
cried, excitedly. “You will fare no worse
by staying here.”</p>

<p>“But captivity means death,” he declared,
quickly; “and I prefer to die as
becomes a soldier. I thank you, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Surely they will not kill you.”</p>

<p>“I shall be shot as a spy!”</p>

<p>“Not if I can save you. What can I
do? Oh, I have it; I will secrete you
where they cannot find you. Follow
me.”</p>

<p>“It will imperil your own life. I can
not do it.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no! Come, quick! See! they are
almost here,” and she caught him excitedly
by the arm.</p>

<p>Forgetting his wounds he followed her
up the stairs.</p>

<p>Reaching the hall she led the way into
one of the adjoining apartments.</p>

<p>“Where can you hide?” she said. “In
that trunk. Will that do?”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>At the same time he glanced around
the room.</p>

<p>The walls were sheathed with boards.
Some wearing apparel was hanging in
one corner: otherwise they were bare.</p>

<p>“If I could get off one of those boards.”</p>

<p>She comprehended his meaning.</p>

<p>“One of them is loose,” she replied.
“Grandpa promised to nail it on this
morning.”</p>

<p>While speaking she began to remove
one of the boards that helped to form
the partition.</p>

<p>“See! there is room for you to stand
in and they will never think of looking
there.”</p>

<p>“But what&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t hesitate. I hear them in the
yard. We have no time to lose. Go in
there and leave the rest to me.”</p>

<p>He could do no better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<p>“Have good courage,” she said softly,
“and I will answer for your safety.”</p>

<p>Before he could reply she had replaced
the board.</p>

<p>She had barely time to hang the garments
over the place, when a loud
thumping was heard at the door.</p>

<p>Overcoming her fears as much as possible,
she hastily descended the stairs.</p>

<p>Captain Dermot and his squad were
at the door.</p>

<p>“Hilloa there!” cried the Confederate
leader. “I should think you were all
dead or run away.”</p>

<p>“What means this unceremonious summons,
Captain Dermot?”</p>

<p>“We are after a cursed Yankee spy.
Have you seen him pass this way, Miss
Morland?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“He rode a dark horse and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But when I saw him he was afoot,
captain,” interrupted one of his followers.
“His horse must have played out.”</p>

<p>“You are sure he was coming this
way?”</p>

<p>“As certain as I am that I am looking
at you.”</p>

<p>“Then he can’t be far off. Are you
sure you have not seen him, Miss Morland?”</p>

<p>“I might have seen him and not have
known him,” she replied evasively.
“Come to think of it a young man did
pass near the house this morning. He
was quite tall, and wore a citizen’s suit
with a black, slouched hat. That much
I noticed.”</p>

<p>“He is our man!” cried Captain Dermot,
excitedly. “Come on, boys. We
shall soon overtake him.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, captain!” exclaimed the
flaxen-haired soldier who had ridden
nearer to the house than any of the
others, “here is something that tells a
story if I’m not mistaken.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he raised on the point of
his gun where it had lain by the door a
fine silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>Mara uttered a low exclamation of
dismay.</p>

<p>Quickly holding the handkerchief up
to the gaze of the others they read the
letters “C. R.” embroidered in one corner.</p>

<p>“They mean Curtis Remington&mdash;Cavalry
Curt,” said the soldier with a smile
of triumph. “He must have dropped it
there.”</p>

<p>“And can’t be far away himself.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is hiding in this vicinity
now.”</p>

<p>“More than likely. Miss Morland, you
have deceived us.”</p>

<p>“Captain Dermot,” said Mara with
quivering lips, “do you doubt my loyalty?
I would rather die than betray
the cause my brother has so nobly espoused.”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt it,” replied the Confederate,
“but we must find that accursed
spy if possible. General Johnston
has offered a thousand dollars to the
man who captures him. You will not
object to our searching your buildings?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no. But is it necessary? Grandpa
is away. Can’t you wait until he returns.”</p>

<p>“Delays are dangerous. Besides Cavalry
Curt is no ordinary man. We must
not waste any more time. Stand aside,
Miss Morland, and let us begin our disagreeable
task.”</p>

<p>She saw that it was madness to offer
further opposition.</p>

<p>Leaving half his number to guard the
buildings and see that no one escaped,
Captain Dermot with the others began a
search for the fugitive scout.</p>

<p>“Here is blood upon the stairs!” cried
the sharp-eyed soldier who had discovered
the tell-tale handkerchief. “He
must have been wounded; he has gone
this way.”</p>

<p>“You’re a brick, Logan!” exclaimed
Captain Dermot, leaping up the stairs
three at a time, “follow me, boys, and
we’ll run the fox to his den. Ha! here is
more blood!”</p>

<p>Mara’s hopes fell as she heard the startling
words.</p>

<p>She had taken a great interest in the
stranger scout and wished that he might
escape.</p>

<p>Again it might fare ill with them were
he found on their premises.</p>

<p>She heard the horde enter the very
room in which the scout was concealed.</p>

<p>Her heart almost ceased its beating.</p>

<p>With trembling steps she ascended the
stairs.</p>

<p>She was met on the second floor by the
Confederate captain.</p>

<p>“We don’t find the hound,” he muttered.
“But he can’t be far away.”</p>

<p>Then as a baleful light flashed from
his piercing eyes he cried:</p>

<p>“Mara Morland, you know where
he is!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A FEARFUL ALTERNATIVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The accusation was so sudden that
she started back with an exclamation of
terror.</p>

<p>“And you shall be made to tell!” he
continued, fiercely, seizing her rudely by
the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Back, ruffian!” she cried, with flashing
eyes, breaking from his clutch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t let her escape!” commanded
Captain Dermot. “She is in league with
the Yankee dog.”</p>

<p>At that moment a loud commotion in
the hall below caught their attention.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” cried Dermot running
to the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>“We’ve got the old man; but he fit
like a wild-cat.”</p>

<p>“Bring him up here at once.”</p>

<p>In spite of his resistance Caleb Morland
was dragged up the stairs.</p>

<p>“What means this treatment, Captain
Dermot?” said the old man, as soon as he
could speak.</p>

<p>“No harm to you, colonel. Perhaps
the boys are a little rough though. Release
him, boys.”</p>

<p>“There, colonel you are a free man.
We are in search of a Yankee spy who is
hiding somewhere on your premises.”</p>

<p>“A Yankee spy hiding on my premises!”
repeated Colonel Morland in amazement.
“Impossible, Captain Dermot.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, colonel, but it is even so.
We saw him come this way, and what
better evidence do you want than that,
picked up at your door,” said the Confederate,
triumphantly, displaying the
handkerchief dropped by the scout.</p>

<p>“He is Cavalry Curt, the most dangerous
man in Sherman’s army.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of him,” acknowledged
the old man, huskily. “But you must
be mistaken in thinking that he is here.
I have only been out of the house a few
minutes, and surely you do not doubt
my loyalty enough to think that I would
give protection to one of Abe Lincoln’s
spies?”</p>

<p>The old man showed great emotion
and his tone was one of honesty.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no; not you, colonel. But&mdash;young
ladies are sometimes rashly influenced
by a good-looking stranger,”
and he looked at Mara who was a silent
spectator.</p>

<p>Colonel Morland caught the meaning
of that look; at least he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Explain yourself, Captain Dermot.”</p>

<p>“Ask the young lady if she has seen
the man we are in quest of,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Mara, have you seen Cavalry Curt?”
questioned her grandparent.</p>

<p>“Grandpa,” and she spoke quite calmly,
“I cannot answer that question, for I do
not know Cavalry Curt, I have told Captain
Dermot that a man answering to his
description was here this morning. He
came here soon after you left me. Where
he is now I cannot tell. Were Captain
Dermot a gentleman he would not trouble
us further.”</p>

<p>“Ha&mdash;ha! you see how it is, captain.
You have no reason to doubt our loyalty,
I hope you will capture the Yankee dog.
Were I not so old I would join you in the
search.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Colonel Morland, you jump to a
hasty conclusion, it is not your loyalty
that we doubt, but the girl’s! We know
the Yankee dog is in this house!”</p>

<p>The other started with a look of amazement.</p>

<p>“I am sure that you are mistaken,
captain; and to prove my sincerity I give
you permission to search my buildings as
much as you like.”</p>

<p>“That we must do, colonel, and shall
level them to the earth but we will find
them.</p>

<p>“Logan and Andrews, see that the old
man and the girl do not leave this room.
The rest of you continue the search.”</p>

<p>“A sorry day it will be for you, colonel,
if we find that spy on your premises.”</p>

<p>Completely overcome, the old man
bowed his head in silence.</p>

<p>Mara, too, was speechless.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the Confederates
gathered around them.</p>

<p>Captain Dermot’s swarthy face looked
blacker than ever.</p>

<p>“It’s no use wasting time in that way,”
he muttered.</p>

<p>“Mara Morland, you know where that
spy is hiding, and, by heavens, you shall
tell us or we will tear this house down
over your heads.”</p>

<p>It was a fearful moment to the maiden.
“Spare us,” she implored. “We are
loyal yet.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell us where Cavalry Curt
is hiding?”</p>

<p>“I cannot!”</p>

<p>“You lie. Colonel Morland, do you uphold
her in this scheme?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no. Mara, if you know where
the spy is secreted tell him and spare us
further trouble.”</p>

<p>“Grandpa, are we to submit to his insolence?
I would that my brother were
here.”</p>

<p>“So do I, my child.”</p>

<p>“He may learn of this sooner than you
will wish,” retorted Captain Dermot,
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Duty compels me to do what is far
from pleasant. Colonel Morland, consider
yourself our prisoner. Buck Logan, see
that he is securely bound.”</p>

<p>“That I will, captain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no&mdash;no!” cried Mara. “Spare
him.”</p>

<p>In spite of her entreaties and his struggles,
Caleb Morland was quickly seized
and bound.</p>

<p>“Now a piece of rope, men. I’ll see if
they can’t be brought to terms.”</p>

<p>The rope was quickly forthcoming.</p>

<p>“Make a slipping noose in one end and
put it around the old man’s neck. There,<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
that’s it. Now, Mara Morland, tell us
where that infernal Yankee is hiding, or
your grandfather swings from that window
within one minute!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AS BRAVE AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a startling tableau.</p>

<p>Colonel Morland looked pale and fearful.
There was no pity in the looks of
his captors. Though used to scenes of
war, and he had served through the
struggle of 1812, he was at a loss to account
for his present treatment.</p>

<p>Mara, on whom the dark eyes of Captain
Dermot were fixed, turned pale,
though she did not lose her self-possession.</p>

<p>“Girl,” he exclaimed, tersely, “where
have you secreted that spy?”</p>

<p>“I deny your right to question me,”
she replied with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>A sardonic smile rested on his thin
lips.</p>

<p>“Answer my question at once, girl, or
the old man shall hang. Then we will
tear the house down but we will find him.
Men, I’ll give her ten seconds to decide,
and then if she persist in her madness
drag the old scoundrel to the window
where he shall hang&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried the clear, sharp voice
of the brave girl. “Dare to harm him
and you die, Captain Dermot!”</p>

<p>She had suddenly drawn a pistol, and
its gleaming muzzle stared the Confederate
chief in the face.</p>

<p>He started back with a cry of terror.</p>

<p>Her beautiful countenance shone with
excitement, but she gave no evidence of
fear.</p>

<p>Her tone was calm and measured as
she said:</p>

<p>“You see that I am in earnest, Captain
Dermot, and the first move that is made
signs your doom. I have undertaken to
save the life of Curtis Remington and I
will do it though it costs me my own.”</p>

<p>A murmur of admiration went up from
the spectators.</p>

<p>Before it had died away a crash was
heard in the room and a portion of one
of the walls fell to the floor.</p>

<p>The next moment, to the amazement
of the Confederates, Cavalry Curt stood
in their presence.</p>

<p>“I cannot allow this to continue,” he
said, firmly.</p>

<p>“Miss Morland, you have my heartfelt
thanks for your interference in my behalf.
But I will relieve you of all further
anxiety. Captain Dermot, since it is me
that you want, I will surrender upon two
conditions.”</p>

<p>A wicked smile played upon the dark
visage of the latter.</p>

<p>No one in the room was more surprised
at the scout’s appearance than Colonel
Morland.</p>

<p>“What are those conditions, pray, Sir
Yank?” sneered Dermot.</p>

<p>“First, that you leave these people in
peace. They are not to blame for my
presence here. Second, that I shall be
treated as a prisoner of war.”</p>

<p>“Of course we intend to do all that you
have asked. So you will surrender?
Men&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold! not too fast. Remember that
I am not in your hands yet.”</p>

<p>“I should like to know what stands
between us.”</p>

<p>“Your life!” was the cool reply.</p>

<p>“Have done with this fooling. Do you
surrender or not? Girl, be careful how
you handle that pistol.”</p>

<p>“You promise that these people shall
not be disturbed, sir?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“And that you will take me to your
headquarters before your commander?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Then I give myself up as a prisoner
of war.”</p>

<p>It required no second bidding for the
soldiers to secure so valuable a captive,
and a minute later Cavalry Curt was in
the power of his foes.</p>

<p>Colonel Morland had been freed, so
that he breathed easier.</p>

<p>Mara looked on in silence, and though
she had lowered the weapon she still held
it in her hand.</p>

<p>“I hope you will lose nothing by your
conduct to-day,” said Captain Dermot,
more in mockery, we suspect, than sincerity.</p>

<p>She offered no reply.</p>

<p>“Come, men,” he continued, “we can
afford to start for headquarters now. We
have done a good day’s work.”</p>

<p>“Good-day, Colonel Morland; I am
sorry for the treatment we were forced to
give you, but it may learn you a lesson.”</p>

<p>A minute later the party were mounting
their horses.</p>

<p>Curt had whispered a kind good-bye
to her who had so nobly defended him,
as his captors bore him out of the room.</p>

<p>“Never fear for me,” he said. “I am a
soldier who is not afraid to die. Give my
regards to Hal when you see him.”</p>

<p>She would fain have spoken to him,
but the Confederate chief pushed her
rudely aside as he hurried past.</p>

<p>She stood at the window watching the
cavalcade in their preparations to start,
while in spite of herself tears came into
her eyes.</p>

<p>Buck Logan returned to the room for<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
something he had forgotten, or at least
pretended to have left.</p>

<p>Mara turned at the sound of his footsteps.</p>

<p>“What, in tears!” he exclaimed in surprise.
“I thought you were too brave a
girl for that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Logan, what will they do
with him?”</p>

<p>“He is a spy and will have to meet the
fate of a spy, I suppose. But I did not
know he was your friend, Mara&mdash;Miss
Morland.”</p>

<p>“I never saw him until to-day, but he
was a friend to Harry. He seems like a
noble man.”</p>

<p>“Well enough I dare say. But do not
let your sympathy rob you of your reason.
The boys are starting and I must not delay
longer. I hope to see you again
soon.”</p>

<p>He had taken one of her hands in his
and pressing it to his lips, he hastily left
the room.</p>

<p>“Mara, I don’t understand this,” said
Colonel Morland, turning to her as the
horsemen rode away with the captive
scout in their midst.</p>

<p>Not without some confusion did she
tell him of the morning’s adventures.</p>

<p>Half an hour later she laid her hand
on his shoulder saying:</p>

<p>“Grandpa, I am going to Dalton.”</p>

<p>“To Dalton?” he echoed. “What for,
my child?”</p>

<p>“To save, if possible, the life of Curtis
Remington.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, child; you are insane now,
to think of it.”</p>

<p>Wild and impracticable as the venture
seemed then, succeeding events not only
made it possible but feasible and imperative
as well; of this more anon.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">TO DIE AT ONCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>General J. E. Johnston, the commander
of the Confederate forces in
Georgia, at the head of forty-five thousand
men, was intrenched at Dalton, lying
in wait for the advancing troops of Sherman,
then marching into this stronghold
of the Confederacy from Chattanooga.</p>

<p>The last Confederate gunboat had been
driven from the Mississippi and the great
basin of the south and west was safe in
Union keeping.</p>

<p>The great strength of the South now
was its inland armies, which were fed by
the granaries and supported by the factories
of Georgia.</p>

<p>Here were the great grain growing
prairies which afforded the sustenance
that an army requires.</p>

<p>In the heart of the state, the center of
a net-work of manufacturing cities
and villages, was Atlanta, from which
the army was supplied with powder,
shot&mdash;in fact, all the appurtenances of
war.</p>

<p>Through Macon and Atlanta ran the
great railroad lines between the eastern
and the western Confederacy.</p>

<p>Georgia then was the Confederate
stronghold.</p>

<p>To rend it asunder from mountain to
sea as had been done in the Mississippi
was the next work of the Northern
troops.</p>

<p>The man called upon to undertake this
herculian task was Sherman.</p>

<p>He had just performed his superb
march of four hundred miles from Vicksburg
to Chattanooga and added to this
another hundred miles to Knoxville in
season to relieve Burnside.</p>

<p>At the head of one hundred thousand
men he was now at Ringgold, on the other
side of the mountain, in direct line with
Dalton and Atlanta biding his time of
action.</p>

<p>To follow the fortunes of Cavalry Curt,
however, we must go to the Confederate
headquarters.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the same day that
witnessed the scout’s capture, General
Johnston, in company with subordinate
officers, was in his tent busily examining
a lot of charts and papers that lay before
him.</p>

<p>“They are still impatient at Richmond
for me to begin the offensive,” said the
commander after a pause, as he looked
up from the documents, and reading for
the third time the latest dispatch from
the Confederate capital. “But I am no
better prepared to do it than when I first
declined to do so last Christmas. Their
plans look well enough on paper, but put
into actual practice must fail. Sherman’s
army more than double ours in number,
and then he is fortified at the very apex
of the two entrances into Georgia. The
moment that I advance on either hand
our rear is open to his attack. Once our
supplies from Atlanta are cut off, we are
lost. No,” he continued thoughtfully,
slowly shaking his head, “I dare not take
the risk. Our wisest course is to draw
the northern forces on as near to Atlanta
as possible before we engage in regular
battle with them. I am anxious&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was interrupted in the midst of his
speech by the sound of a body of horsemen
passing the tent.</p>

<p>“It is Captain Dermot’s scouting
squad,” exclaimed one.</p>

<p>“And see, he has a prisoner,” added
another. “I truly believe it is the devil
he went in quest of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<p>“Orderly, here; stop Captain Dermot.
I wish to speak to him.”</p>

<p>Captain Dermot, proud of his day’s
work, was only too glad to meet his
superior, and he saluted him with an air
of triumph.</p>

<p>“You have returned sooner than we
expected, Captain Dermot. Whom have
you there?”</p>

<p>“Cavalry Curt, General Johnston.”</p>

<p>“Sherman’s spy?”</p>

<p>“The same, general. The identical
person, too, who was in our midst yesterday
disguised as a Quaker farmer, and
who made such a daring ride for freedom.</p>

<p>“We tracked him to the mountain, and
this morning succeeded in effecting his
capture, though I will say he is a good
fighter.”</p>

<p>“You have done well, Captain Dermot,
and nobly won the commission promised
you for his capture.”</p>

<p>“Many thanks, General Johnston,” replied
the elated officer bowing low.
“And if I may be so bold I would recommend
my friend, Sergeant Logan, as
deserving of favor. We owe our success
in a great measure to him.”</p>

<p>“I will remember your suggestion,
major,” giving the other for the first time
his new rank.</p>

<p>“So this is Cavalry Curt,” he continued,
turning to the prisoner. “Ah, you hardly
look like the reckless dare-devil you have
been pictured; but from your present
appearance I can see that you have been
sorely driven. I suppose you realize
your situation.”</p>

<p>“Better perhaps than you, general,”
replied Curt, speaking for the first time,
his cool, measured tone sending a thrill
through the frames of his listeners.</p>

<p>“You are too brave a man to belong to
the cause you have espoused,” continued
the Confederate commander. “Let me
give you a chance to see yonder sun set.”</p>

<p>“General Johnston,” said the scout,
quickly, comprehending the other’s
meaning, “I am brave enough to meet
death but not brave enough to betray
my country.”</p>

<p>“My faith, but I like your appearance
much. You shall have a commission
if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, general, but here is a
dispatch for you and a courier awaits
your pleasure.”</p>

<p>The commander took the packet from
his orderly’s hand, and with a nervous
hand broke the seal.</p>

<p>“Sherman’s army is on the move,” he
muttered under his breath. “Thomas is
on a march to Buzzard’s Gap. At last the
campaign has opened and the time for
more decisive action on our part has
come. Colonel Markham,” turning to
one of his subordinates, “I leave the
fate of the prisoner in your hands.
More important duties engage my attention.
Have ten men detailed from
your regiment placed under charge of a
competent officer who shall see that the
prisoner immediately meets the fate of a
spy. Remember, colonel, immediately;
for we know not how soon we may be
obliged to move. Sherman has begun
work.”</p>

<p>“I will see that your orders are carried
out to the letter, general.”</p>

<p>Captain Morland was alone in his tent,
when an orderly appeared at the door
and handed him a paper.</p>

<p>We need not be told that he is Mara
Morland’s brother; there is a strong likeness
between the two.</p>

<p>He is a manly-looking fellow who has
entered heart and soul into the struggle
for the Southern cause. He has already
seen much of hard service and is ready
for more.</p>

<p>Tearing open the paper he read:</p>

<p class="center">“<em>Captain Morland</em>:&mdash;Report to me at

soon as possible.</p>

<p class="center" style="padding-left:3em">“<span class="smcap">Philip Markham</span>, Colonel.”</p>
</div>

<p>“I wonder what is up now,” he mused,
preparing at once to obey his orders.
“Something unusual; I am certain that
he summons me rather than Lieutenant
Dodge.”</p>

<p>His curiosity well aroused, Captain
Morland acted very promptly.</p>

<p>“On hand with your usual alacrity,
captain,” greeted his superior. “I have
a delicate task on call else I should not
have selected you. You see our men
have captured a troublesome fellow
called Cavalry Curt, one of Sherman’s
spies. He is to be shot at sunset and the
unpleasant duty has been assigned to
you. See that there is no blunder in the
proceedings. You will find him under
guard down at the lower barracks. As
soon as it is over report to me. By the
way news have come that Sherman is beginning
hostilities. It looks as if we
might be called to the front at any moment.
It is no time to harbor spies.
Captain Morland, your duty is plain. I
trust we can depend upon you for the
work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>“You can, Colonel Markham, though
I wish some one else might have been selected.”</p>

<p>At the head of his squad Captain Morland
repaired as rapidly as possible to the
lower barracks, to find the guard with
the prisoner anxiously awaiting his arrival.</p>

<p>“Is everything in readiness, sergeant?”
asked the captain. “We have no time to
spare.”</p>

<p>“A grave has been dug and there is no
need for further delays. I resign the
prisoner into your hands, Captain Morland.”</p>

<p>“Very well; place the prisoner at the
edge of the pit and measure off twenty
yards. We must have this over as soon
as possible.”</p>

<p>Cavalry Curt sent a swift glance upon
the Confederate captain as he spoke, and
a low groan escaped his lips.</p>

<p>The next instant he turned his face
away as if watching the setting sun.</p>

<p>He had recognized his former friend
but the discovery only seemed to make
his fate harder to bear.</p>

<p>“I hope Hal won’t recognize me,” he
thought. “It will only make his duty
the more difficult to perform.”</p>

<p>Those who heard his groan attributed
its utterance to a different cause than
that which produced it.</p>

<p>“So your courage begins to fail you,”
said one of those whose duty it was to
remove him to the fated post. “Well it
will soon be over. Will you be blindfolded?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>Cavalry Curt uttered the affirmative
when the thought occurred to him that
it would serve to hide his face.</p>

<p>But his voice had betrayed him.</p>

<p>Captain Morland turned his searching
gaze upon him and their eyes met.</p>

<p>“Curt Remington!”</p>

<p>“Hal Morland!”</p>

<p>It was a strange meeting for old
friends.</p>

<p>The scout was the first to recover his
self-possession.</p>

<p>“I hoped you wouldn’t recognize me,
Hal. But do your duty. It is a poor
soldier who is afraid to die.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no! not that, Curt. My God, I
did not dream of this. I have not forgot
the debt that I owe you. How came
you here?”</p>

<p>“I was caught as a spy. But see, the
sun is setting. You jeopardize your own
life by this delay. Once more I ask you
to do your duty.”</p>

<p>Captain Morland made a few swift
passes which were quickly answered by
the other.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” he exclaimed with a
lighter countenance. “There isn’t power
enough in the South to compel me to do
this deed.”</p>

<p>Turning to the wondering soldiers he
said:</p>

<p>“Boys, that man is a Freemason. So
am I. They may do what they will to
me, but I cannot see this work go on. I
am bound by an oath that I cannot
break to harm no one of the fraternity.
Some one else must finish this work. For
the present I order him to the guard-house.
See that he does not escape. I
will report to headquarters.”</p>

<p>With a few passes made to the captive
scout, which the others of course did not
understand, he wheeled and started for
the colonel’s tent.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe Captain
Morland’s feeling as he presented himself
to his superior.</p>

<p>“What, have you got over with it as
soon as this, captain? I think you have
outdone yourself this time.”</p>

<p>“And you will have great reason for
thinking so, Colonel Markham, when I
ask to be released from this work, as
I do.”</p>

<p>“Wish to be released from the work?”
exclaimed the other. “I never knew
you to shirk from a duty before, Captain
Morland. It was for that very reason I
selected you of all others.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, colonel, but for once I
must prove faithless to your trust, even
though I lose my commission by it. I
am sorry it has happened.”</p>

<p>“Explain yourself,” was the impatient
rejoinder.</p>

<p>“The prisoner is a Freemason and so
am I. My oath forbids&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! ho! so that is it. I see&mdash;I see!”
exclaimed the astonished colonel. “We
can make that all right, captain. I feared
it was something else.”</p>

<p>“I trust my loyalty is above suspicion,
colonel.”</p>

<p>“So it is; on my faith, it is. But what
have you done with the prisoner?”</p>

<p>“I ordered him to the guard-house to
be kept under strict surveillance.”</p>

<p>“You did right. He will be safe there
until morning. He shall be attended to
then. I have just received an important
notice from headquarters. Our brigade
has been ordered to the relief at Buzzard’s
Gap and we are likely to receive
marching orders at any moment. It
looks as though we were in for hot
work.”</p>

<p>“Anything to break the monotony of
this camp life,” exclaimed Morland, “but
I have a little business to look after, so
you must excuse me, colonel.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; only see that the boys are
in readiness for a start. Good-evening.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">CAPTAIN MORLAND AGAIN SURPRISED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Some one to see you, Captain Morland,”
was the greeting he received upon
reaching his tent.</p>

<p>Entering he saw a person standing in
the center of the apartment as if anxiously
awaiting his coming.</p>

<p>“Captain Morland, I believe,” said the
visitor.</p>

<p>“At your service, sir. I do not recognize
you in the darkness, though your
voice has a familiar ring.”</p>

<p>“I would see you alone a few minutes,
captain.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I will give directions not
to be disturbed. I will be back in a moment.”</p>

<p>He soon returned closing the tent
opening behind him.</p>

<p>“Will you please make known your errand?”</p>

<p>“Is it possible, brother,” said the other
lowly, “that my disguise is so complete
you do not recognize me?”</p>

<p>Had a cannon-ball dropped at his feet
Captain Morland could not have been
more surprised.</p>

<p>“What! Mara! you here?”</p>

<p>“Hush! don’t speak my name.”</p>

<p>“But what does this mean? What has
happened?”</p>

<p>Unheeding his questions she asked,
catching him by the arm:</p>

<p>“Oh, Harry! have you seen him? Am
I too late?”</p>

<p>Again he started with surprise, but in
a moment he comprehended her meaning.</p>

<p>“You refer to Curtis Remington. I
have seen him.”</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and he lives?”</p>

<p>Her tone was hardly audible.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad. Is he safe?”</p>

<p>“Until morning.”</p>

<p>“He must be saved!”</p>

<p>“Alas! I fear it is impossible. But
tell me how you came here. I am in a
fog.”</p>

<p>In a few words she told of the morning’s
adventure; and then how she, disguised,
had succeeded in reaching the
place after running the gantlet of detection.</p>

<p>“I felt it my duty to do something to
save him. I feared you would not know
of his being here. So I have come.”</p>

<p>“But you have run a fearful risk.”</p>

<p>“Do not speak of that. But tell me
what can be done for him.”</p>

<p>Captain Morland quickly acquainted
her with the particulars of the postponed
execution.</p>

<p>“It is an unpleasant turn of affairs,”
he said in conclusion, “but no more than
one must be prepared to meet in the fortunes
of war. Curt is a spy and a dreaded
foe to our cause. I love him as a brother,
but am powerless to help him. God
knows I would gladly save him if I
could.”</p>

<p>She wrung her hands in agony.</p>

<p>“And you are sure that he will be shot
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“As certain as I am that the sun will
rise. But, Mara, this is weak in you.
He is not the only one&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;I know, brother. But I&mdash;I
love him! I am willing to give my life
to save him!”</p>

<p>She reeled to and fro as if she would
fall.</p>

<p>“This is weak in you, Mara,” he said,
folding her to his breast. “Come, put
him from your mind; and in the morning
you must return home. Grandfather&mdash;hark!
there is the bugle-call. We have
had marching orders. I must go. Our
brigade is ordered to Buzzard’s Gap.”</p>

<p>Pressing a hurried kiss upon her brow,
he gently put her from him.</p>

<p>“It is hard to leave you, but I must.
Stay here to-night and start for home in
the morning,” he said. “You will be
careful of yourself, Mara, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Harry. Oh, this is dreadful.”</p>

<p>“Be brave&mdash;ha! I mustn’t tarry longer.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Another kiss and he was gone.</p>

<p>Mara Morland pressed her hands to
her temples in a dazed, bewildered state
of mind.</p>

<p>Then she suddenly started up.</p>

<p>“What have I done?” she asked herself.
“He is gone and I have told him
nothing. God forgive me that I should
so far have forgotten my duty. These
tears ill become the garb that I wear. I
thought that I had more self-control. I
wonder if he is gone? He said to Buzzard’s
Gap. That is a part of Sherman’s
design. His plans are working well. I
must act ere it is too late.”</p>

<p>While speaking thus she was brushing
the tear drops from her eyes.</p>

<p>As soon as she had somewhat gained
control of herself she peered out of the
tent.</p>

<p>All was bustle and excitement.</p>

<p>“It is no use to look for him now. I
must go to the commander’s headquarters.”</p>

<p>Acting upon this thought she boldly
left the tent.</p>

<p>No one seemed to notice her and she
breathed easier as she hurried on her
way.</p>

<p>At last to her relief the quarters of
General Johnston was reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>The commander, however, was very
busy and she had to wait what seemed
to her a long time.</p>

<p>She was glad that it was night for in
the semi-darkness she escaped in part
the scrutinous gaze of the lookers-on.</p>

<p>“Come, there is no time to spare if you
must speak to the commander,” exclaimed
the brusque orderly at last.</p>

<p>“General, some one to see you who
will not take ‘No’ for an answer.”</p>

<p>With high-beating heart Mara advanced
into the presence of the impatient
chief.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">MARA MORLAND’S MISSION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>If it was General Johnston’s aim to
draw the Northern troops as near as
possible to Atlanta before engaging in
the culminating battle, General Sherman,
on the other hand, was equally as anxious
to meet his foe at an early day and as
far from the Confederate arsenal as it
might be. Could he shatter Johnston’s
army, as he felt confident of doing, his
march to the sea would be simply a
“walk over.”</p>

<p>The great mountain system of East
Tennessee outstretched like a giant arm
into the heart of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Leaving Chattanooga, the natural bastion
on the lines of the Georgian communication,
Sherman paused at Ringgold,
and from this place inaugurated
his grand strategic movement.</p>

<p>Through Rocky Face Mountain from
the latter place ran a narrow ravine affording
the only passage to the eastern
valley, on the one hand, and along whose
rocky bottom wound the highway and
railroad to Dalton.</p>

<p>At the mouth of this valley, called Buzzard’s
Roost Gap, Johnston had erected
strong defenses by planting his batteries
on the rocky spurs of the mountain sides.
To make his position doubly certain he
had flooded the ravine by dams in the
creek.</p>

<p>This position but illustrated Johnston’s
entire situation, and Sherman’s practical
eye saw that to drive him from his
craggy citadel he must make a detour to
the south and cut off his communication
with Atlanta.</p>

<p>This task was assigned to McPherson.</p>

<p>Thomas meanwhile, to hold the Confederates’
attention in that direction,
was to actually storm Buzzard’s Gap.</p>

<p>Schofield was to march against the
enemy’s right flank thus adding to the
deception of Thomas’ attack.</p>

<p>The purpose in view, however, was for
McPherson to reach Reseca, a place
about twenty miles south of Dalton, and
there fall upon the railroad thus cutting
off the Confederate’s supplies.</p>

<p>Intrenching himself there McPherson
was to wage war upon Johnston in
flank until he would be obliged to turn
to grapple with him, when the rear
would be open to Thomas and Schofield.</p>

<p>Johnston had received intelligence of
the contemplated attack on Buzzard’s
Gap as has been shown. Sherman’s real
intentions were as yet unknown to him.</p>

<p>We have been thus particular in stating
the situation to show the importance
of Mara Morland’s mission to Johnston’s
quarters on that evening.</p>

<p>“Well, what is your business, sir?”
asked General Johnston, without looking
up from the chart that he was examining,
as Mara in her disguise stood before him.</p>

<p>“Important, sir, if I mistake not. I
am the bearer of a message from Boyd
Wyman.”</p>

<p>“Boyd Wyman!” exclaimed the general
quickly looking up. “Where is he?”</p>

<p>“At the home of Colonel Morland,
sir. He is wounded and could not come.”</p>

<p>“So that accounts for his continued
absence. I sent him to learn if possible
Sherman’s projected plans. I had began
to fear that some mischance had overtaken
him.”</p>

<p>“He barely escaped with his life, sir;
and reached our place this morning unable
to go further. Here are the papers,
sir, he requested me to hand you.”</p>

<p>General Johnston eagerly took the
packet and tearing it open was soon
perusing its contents.</p>

<p>Mara saw his countenance change as
he read on, and the hand that held the
paper trembled.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he broke forth, at last,
“this puts a new phase on the matter.
Had I known this an hour earlier my
plans would have been laid differently.
But better late than never. We have
time enough to reach there. Mr. Morland,
for that is the name Wyman gives
you, you have done us a great service.
Any favor I can do you?”</p>

<p>“I would like a pass, sir, so that I can
return home.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, and bear my good wishes
to Wyman.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. And&mdash;and if it is not
asking too much,” stammered Mara, “I
would like permission to visit Curtis
Remington, the captive spy.”</p>

<p>Her heart seemed to stop its beating as
she waited for his reply.</p>

<p>The general looked up with a frown.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. He was to
have been shot at sunset, but some one
blundered. Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“I knew him at one time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>“I see no harm in granting your request,
and in consideration of the service
you have done us, I will.”</p>

<p>Seizing pen and paper he began to hurriedly
write.</p>

<p>“Your full name, please.”</p>

<p>“Mara Morland.”</p>

<p>She could have bitten her tongue out
for giving utterance to the name. But
it was just as well. “Mara” seemed
as appropriate for a man as a woman.</p>

<p>“There you are,” declared the commander,
handing her two slips of paper;
“good-evening.”</p>

<p>Glad to get away so easy, she passed out
of the tent.</p>

<p>Johnston, now familiar with the enemy’s
plans, immediately held a council
with some of his subordinate officers.</p>

<p>Leaving him to prepare for a meeting
with McPherson at Reseca we will follow
the fortunes of Mara Morland.</p>

<p>The uppermost thought in her mind
now was to rescue Cavalry Curt.</p>

<p>No one knew better than she the peril
of the undertaking, and a less brave
heart would have shrunk from the attempt.</p>

<p>But one course seemed open to her and
she resolved to carry it out.</p>

<p>It was too early in the night, however,
for the work to be begun so she sauntered
toward her brother’s tent, watchful of all
that was transpiring around her.</p>

<p>Passing one of the camp-fires she heard
loud voices, and coupled with other
names she fancied she heard her own.</p>

<p>Advancing in a listless manner she got
within hearing without attracting attention.</p>

<p>The party was composed of a portion
of Captain Dermot’s scouting squad.</p>

<p>She saw Lieutenant Logan, easily distinguished
by his long, flaxen hair among
them.</p>

<p>He was speaking.</p>

<p>She held her breath at the sound of his
voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is true grit every time. I
admired her spunk and I didn’t like her
course of action.”</p>

<p>“Think she is spoony on the Yank?”</p>

<p>“Looks like it. But I tell you those
Morlands are going to get into trouble, if
they ain’t already, over that spy. The
captain’s course this afternoon was
shameful.”</p>

<p>“S’pose they’ll shoot the spy in the
morning?”</p>

<p>“Of course; and I should like the job.
Reckon they wouldn’t find me a Freemason&mdash;ha&mdash;ho!
That’s the best joke I
have heard lately.”</p>

<p>“Is it true the colonel has sent a man
up to old Morland’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he smells a rat somewhere.
Leastways the major does, and he has
put him up to it.”</p>

<p>“By the way, the captain fills his new
rank well.”</p>

<p>Hearing nothing more of interest to
her, Mara finally turned away to seek
Captain Morland’s tent.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE WIZARD SCOUT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As Mara came in sight of her brother’s
tent she saw some one pacing slowly
back and forth before its entrance.</p>

<p>Advancing boldly she drew nearer until
he turned at the sound of her approach
and pausing in his beat coolly
faced her.</p>

<p>His long, flowing hair and beard was
white with the frosts of many years.</p>

<p>His tall form, however, gave no indication
of the weight of years that it
bore.</p>

<p>His eyes, too, retained all the fire of
youth. Ay, from out of their depths
flashed at times the light which told
plainly of the slumbering flame of insanity.</p>

<p>“I knew you would come here,” he
said, calmly.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;I do not know you,” exclaimed
Mara in alarm, glancing toward a group
of soldiers just beyond.</p>

<p>“Nor need you marvel at that,” replied
the stranger, lowly. “I know every
man in the Confederate army, but no
one knows me! Nor would they recognize
me if they did. The tent is vacated now;
come in.”</p>

<p>She might do worse than to obey.</p>

<p>“You are on a dangerous errand,
young woman,” were his first words.</p>

<p>She started with a low exclamation of
fear.</p>

<p>“Do not be alarmed,” he hastened to say.
“I will be more careful how I speak.
You have nothing to fear from me. You
are cleverly disguised. It is to warn you
that I am here.”</p>

<p>“Pray who are you?”</p>

<p>“They call me Old Fatality. But that
is only a name synonymous with my
work, you know. All other names are
misnomers, however, so away with them.
You have been rash in coming here when
your own home is in jeopardy. You are
needed there, even now. Is the life of a
stranger dearer to you than the loved
ones at home?”</p>

<p>She was silent, perplexed, bewildered.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he went on. “You
have come here in the cause of your state.
By your heroic conduct you have averted
the disaster that hangs over the army of
Georgia. But its downfall is surely coming.<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
You will live to regret that you lent
your arm to its support. Your heart
should be wholly with your patriot lover.
But I am detaining you here when you
should be on your homeward journey.
Even now all that you hold dear on
earth is under the bane. Within a week
you will be alone&mdash;friendless and hopeless.”</p>

<p>“Sir, begone!” she exclaimed. “Who
are you who dares to breathe the breath
of treason?”</p>

<p>It was too dark for either to see the
other’s face plainly, but both were greatly
excited.</p>

<p>Mara stood with extended arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “I have
only your good at heart. See, I am going.”</p>

<p>He went as far as the edge of the tent
and peered cautiously out.</p>

<p>The excitement of the camp scene had
somewhat died away.</p>

<p>With a hasty glance he took in the view,
when to the surprise of Mara, he rapidly
returned to her side.</p>

<p>“Be calm,” he said in a tone hardly
above a whisper. “You have come to
rescue Cavalry Curt! So have I! Listen
to my directions and it shall be well.
You can trust me.”</p>

<p>More surprised than ever Mara bowed
her head.</p>

<p>“You have a pass for him?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then go boldly down to his place of
confinement and demand an entrance.
The guard will pass you. Let the prisoner
don this suit of gray,” handing her
a bundle that he carried under his cloak.
“Together then leave the place. I will be
on guard when you come out. Be bold
and it shall be well with you and him.
Separate at once. Do you then go home
with all speed possible. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>She could hardly credit his words.</p>

<p>“You can trust me,” he declared seeing
her hesitation. “If you have any doubt
ask Cavalry Curt if he knows the Wizard
of the Army.”</p>

<p>At the mention of that name she gazed
upon him spellbound. Could she be
really gazing upon the wonderful man
whose startling reputation had reached
even her mountain home?</p>

<p>“I have heard of you,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“I stopped at your house once when
crossing the mountains. In spite of your
disguise I recognized you by your voice
as soon as you spoke. I never forget a
voice. You can trust me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Good. Wait an hour; then go ahead.
You will find me ready to do my part.”</p>

<p>He was moving away, when she caught
him by the arm.</p>

<p>“You will see Cavalry Curt when he has
escaped?”</p>

<p>“Without doubt.”</p>

<p>“A favor then, please.”</p>

<p>“It is granted.”</p>

<p>“You will not mention my name to
him? He must not know that I helped
him to get free.”</p>

<p>“Ha! I see. Your secret is safe with
me.”</p>

<p>The next moment he disappeared from
sight.</p>

<p>Time passed slowly enough to Mara as
she waited for the hour to wear away.</p>

<p>Nothing new occurred to awaken her
interest.</p>

<p>As she pondered over the events of the
evening she wondered more and more
over the unexpected appearance of the
Wizard Scout.</p>

<p>Who was he? From whence had he
come? and how had he learned of her
presence there?</p>

<p>Then too his fearful warning&mdash;must she
put credence in that? The thought
startled her.</p>

<p>She had heard of him before&mdash;had
heard that he was mad.</p>

<p>Were this the fact, could she depend
upon his assistance in the rescue of Cavalry
Curt?</p>

<p>The more she reviewed her situation,
the more she became entangled in the
web of mystery and doubt.</p>

<p>The time for action came at last and
she resolved to hazard the desperate
venture.</p>

<p>Not without many misgivings did she
start on her perilous mission.</p>

<p>“’Tis his life or mine!” she murmured
under her breath.</p>

<p>Running the gantlet of others, Mara at
last reached the guard who stood on duty
over the captive scout.</p>

<p>“A permission to see Cavalry Curt?”</p>

<p>“Who from, mister?”</p>

<p>“General Johnston.”</p>

<p>“Sho! so ’tis. Genuine, by Jeff. Git
’long and be lively.”</p>

<p>Glad to pass so easily Mara entered the
doomed spy’s quarters.</p>

<p>He was lying upon the bare earth as if
asleep when she entered, to quickly look
up at sight of her.</p>

<p>“Is this Cavalry Curt?” she asked in a
low tone.</p>

<p>“They call me by that name sometimes.”</p>

<p>“I need not ask if you are anxious to
escape from your present plight.”</p>

<p>Her tone was low and her calmness
surprised herself.</p>

<p>“Hardly. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“A friend. Let me prove it.”</p>

<p>No sooner had she spoken than she cut
the ligatures that bound him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>“May heaven bless you,” he murmured,
starting to his feet, to find his limbs so
cramped and benumbed that it was some
time before he could stand.</p>

<p>“Here, don this suit of gray. It will
help you escape detection. I will see
that no one enters.”</p>

<p>Cavalry Curt quickly made the
change.</p>

<p>“I am ready,” he whispered. “But
how are we to run the guard?”</p>

<p>“Follow me closely.”</p>

<p>“Into the jaws of death though it be,”
replied the scout through his clinched
teeth. “I wish I were armed.”</p>

<p>“Take this,” and Mara thrust a revolver
into his hand.</p>

<p>“Thanks. Lead on. I am impatient
to get out of this place.”</p>

<p>“Come.”</p>

<p>But Mara’s heart sank within her as
they reached the door.</p>

<p>The same sentry was on duty as had
been when she entered the building.</p>

<p>The Wizard Scout had failed to do his
part.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WAS HE MAD?</span></h2>
</div>


<p>This was the first thought that flashed
through her mind.</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>Was it fancy or did the guard beckon
her to come?</p>

<p>It was too late to turn back.</p>

<p>She rapidly advanced, with Cavalry
Curt beside her.</p>

<p>To her joy the sentry merely glancing
up allowed them to pass.</p>

<p>“We must separate now,” said Mara a
minute later. “I trust you will have no
further trouble.”</p>

<p>“Have no fear for me. But to whom
am I indebted for this kind act?”</p>

<p>“To the Wizard Scout,” replied Mara,
and the next instant he was alone.</p>

<p>“A strange man,” mused Cavalry Curt.
“But I have no time to waste in speculation.
As I am not needed here I must
start for the general’s headquarters. He
will think I am a tardy errand-boy.”</p>

<p>But Cavalry Curt was not on his own
footing yet.</p>

<p>In the very heart of the enemy’s encampment
it was no easy matter to run
the gantlet of his foes.</p>

<p>His disguise, however, seemed sufficient,
for few had seen his face.</p>

<p>Again, he was familiar with every rod
of the country.</p>

<p>With full confidence in his ability to
escape he coolly followed his course.</p>

<p>The boom of cannon was heard in the
distance, coming from the direction of
Rocky Face Mountain.</p>

<p>It told that the fight at Buzzard’s Roost
Gap had begun.</p>

<p>“I am more needed at Reseca,” he
mused. “Thither will I shape my course.
Ha! as I live Johnston is sending troops
to that place. He has discovered Sherman’s
ruse. I wonder if McPherson will
fall into the trap. I&mdash;it is a risky undertaking,
but I am in for it. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Helloa, Charley,” exclaimed some one
breaking in upon his thoughts, “ain’t
your regiment going to Reseca!”</p>

<p>The speaker had stepped from one of
the tents near at hand.</p>

<p>“Hang it, yes,” growled Curt in a disguised
tone, instantly adapting himself
to the new situation. “And I’m in a
deuced of a fix.”</p>

<p>“I thought the 20th was going. What’s
the trouble?”</p>

<p>“My equipments are down to the barracks.
I just stepped into Jackson’s
mess. Let me take your gun. Quick or
I shall be too late. The last call has
sounded.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s your shooter. Tell me
how many Yanks you kill. I wish I was
going. I’ve got&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Cavalry Curt stopped to hear no
more.</p>

<p>Snatching the gun from the other’s
hands he started on a run toward the
troops.</p>

<p>“The 20th,” he panted of a corporal.</p>

<p>“To the right, sir.”</p>

<p>Watching his opportunity he fell into
the ranks and a few minutes later was
marching with the Confederates on toward
Reseca.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour he had escaped
from the guard-house and with a
recklessness of spirit that characterized
his conduct had joined the Southern
ranks.</p>

<p>Wild as the move seemed it proved to
have been the very best he could have
made.</p>

<p>In less than another half hour the
news of his escape flew over the encampment
like wildfire.</p>

<p>His name was on every lip and an exciting
search was made for him.</p>

<p>For a time at least he was safe from
them.</p>

<p>One other little incident deserves our
attention before we turn to record the
fortunes of Mara Morland.</p>

<p>It may have been two hours after the
escape of Cavalry Curt was discovered
that General Johnston was startled by
the appearance of an old man in his tent.</p>

<p>He had forbidden anyone to enter and
was trying to get a little rest which he
was so much in need of.</p>

<p>“What means this intrusion?” he asked
starting up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing&mdash;noth-ing&mdash;no-thing&mdash;not
much. Thought I must see you.”</p>

<p>“Orderly Knox&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The strange visitor stopped him with a
wave of the hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble yourself, general, I’m
Old Fatality and I thought&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>General Johnston repeated the name
in a husky tone.</p>

<p>“Yes; I am Old Fatality,” the other
went on, unheeding the commander’s
discomfiture; “and though my errand
is not a pleasant one it is none the
less&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Orderly Knox&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop, general! three ain’t company!”</p>

<p>One of the general’s aides entered the
tent.</p>

<p>“What is it, general?”</p>

<p>“Put that man out. He is disturbing
me. How dared you let him in?”</p>

<p>“How in the dickens did he get in?
Mercy me, it is the mad wizard! Come
along here, old man; you are not wanted
here.”</p>

<p>“Of course I ain’t. Misfortune ain’t
wanted anywhere; but you have to take
what the Lord sends, don’t you? I have
taken the trouble to come here and I am
going to stay with you&mdash;my spirit if not
my body. I was with Beauregard at
Shiloh, with Pemberton at Vicksburg,
with Bragg at Chattanooga and&mdash;you
know the result. I am sorry for you,
General Johnston, for you are worthy of
a better cause than which has led you
into the field, but defeat is as sure to be
your portion as night is to follow day.
Adieu.”</p>

<p>As silently as a shadow he passed out,
the spectators unable to throw off the
spell which he had thrown over them by
his burning words and wild manner.</p>

<p>When they did recover their self-possession
enough to look for him he was
gone as silently and mysteriously as he
had appeared.</p>

<p>Though no one may have believed his
words they were never forgotten; and
later on they were recalled with a startling
distinctness.</p>

</div>


<p>Fortunately for Mara Morland she had
passed the pickets before the discovery
of Cavalry Curt’s escape.</p>

<p>We doubt if she would have succeeded
in doing so then.</p>

<p>The night was clear starlight and she
had no difficulty in following the way.</p>

<p>She was mounted on the same horse
she had ridden in coming to Dalton and
it was barely two hours ride to her home.</p>

<p>A part of her journey lay on the road
to Buzzard’s Gap.</p>

<p>Anxious to reach home Mara was riding
at a smart canter when she fancied she
heard the sound of hoof-strokes behind
her.</p>

<p>Thinking nothing strange of this she
kept on her way at her former rate of
speed.</p>

<p>The sounds continued and even grew
plainer, until she was aware that not one
rider but several horsemen were following
her.</p>

<p>“It must be a skirmishing party,” she
thought, “or it may be troops going to
Buzzard’s Gap.”</p>

<p>Whichever case it might be she had no
desire to be seen so she urged her horse
on a faster gait&mdash;faster and faster until
she fairly flew along the way.</p>

<p>Still to her surprise the horsemen
seemed to come nearer.</p>

<p>Surprise soon gave place to alarm for
she felt now that she was pursued.</p>

<p>Just as she was coming to this conclusion
she reached the point where she
must turn from the Buzzard’s Gap road
in order to reach her home.</p>

<p>This then would prove the test. If the
riders kept straight on she need have no
further fear. If not&mdash;she dared not contemplate
the worst.</p>

<p>She heard them reach the forks of the
road, and for a moment she thought
they passed on; and then a low exclamation
escaped her lips as she realized
that her worst fears were stern facts.</p>

<p>The horsemen were in earnest pursuit
of her!</p>

<p>The road now was more broken and her
progress was slower.</p>

<p>She was a good rider, but her horse
was no match for those in pursuit.</p>

<p>She had gone perhaps a couple of miles
further when a loud shout attracted her
attention, and looking back she saw her
pursuers in plain sight!</p>

<p>The foremost was waving something in
the air, as if motioning for her to stop.</p>

<p>At first thought she was inclined to do
so, but something in their manner seemed
to tell her that their presence boded her
no good.</p>

<p>Their shouts were like those of a maddened
mob rather than the words of
friends.</p>

<p>With her white face set despairingly
toward home she swept wildly on.</p>

<p>Her long hair broke from its confinement,
to stream in the night air, adding
to the wildness of her appearance.</p>

<p>Over the hills and through the valleys
she flew, the clatter of her enemies in
pursuit growing plainer and nearer.</p>

<p>Then shots were fired while the bullets
flew uncomfortably near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>But one thought was in her mind now.</p>

<p>Could she reach home?</p>

<p>Ever and anon she glanced wildly back,
and every time her hopes sank lower.</p>

<p>“Hold up there if you value your life!”
thundered the leader of the horsemen.</p>

<p>His words only served to make her
urge her failing horse on to greater exertions.</p>

<p>The next moment her home burst into
view.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the hour she saw a
light at its windows.</p>

<p>A murmured thanksgiving escaped her
lips.</p>

<p>“Almost there!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>A minute later she rode furiously into
the yard.</p>

<p>Reining up her foam-flecked horse in
front of the door she sprang from the
saddle just as her grandfather appeared
in the doorway with a light in his hand.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” he cried, excitedly.</p>

<p>“I am pursued! Oh, save me!” she
panted, falling exhausted on the threshold.</p>

<p>With a cry almost human the steed she
had ridden staggered forward and fell at
the old man’s feet in the throes of death!</p>

<p>At the same instant the horsemen
dashed upon the scene.</p>

<p>“What, ho! there!” cried the leader.
“It is a long race that has no end!”</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” asked Colonel
Morland, trembling like an aspen leaf.</p>

<p>“We are after Cavalry Curt! He has
made a bold dash for freedom. Stand
aside, old man, if you value your
life!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no! you shall not harm her!”
cried the old soldier, bending over Mara,
who was just opening her eyes.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, my child?”</p>

<p>“No; but see they are coming. Back&mdash;back,
every man of you! I am armed!”</p>

<p>She had gained her feet and like a
tigress at bay faced them.</p>

<p>Some of the party had dismounted and
were advancing.</p>

<p>“Yes, keep back! keep back!” warned
Colonel Morland with both arms outstretched.</p>

<p>“Great King! he is a woman!” exclaimed
one of the horsemen, as he saw
Mara’s long hair falling down her neck
and shoulders.</p>

<p>“Woman or devil,” cried the leader,
“seize her. She is Cavalry Curt; or the
one in league with him.”</p>

<p>Mara was armed and she had so far recovered
her self-possession as to bid defiance
to them.</p>

<p>“She means business,” ejaculated the
foremost of the would-be captors.</p>

<p>“Fire and furies!” roared the chief,
urging his horse forward to the front of
his men, “we&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Mara’s ringing tone checked his
speech.</p>

<p>“Advance another step at the peril of
your life.”</p>

<p>“Traitors!” hissed the others, “your
lives shall pay for this.”</p>

<p>“Explain your errand,” said Colonel
Morland, again speaking. “My doors
are open <a id="Ref_17a" href="#BRef_17a">to the al&mdash;&mdash;</a>”</p>

<p>“<a id="Ref_17b" href="#BRef_17b">Old man, lie</a>. By your side
stands as great a traitor as you ever
knew. We want him or her as the case
may be and we&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The sharp report of a rifle suddenly
drowned his speech.</p>

<p>With a low groan Colonel Morland sank
to the floor.</p>

<p>“You have killed him! You have killed
him!” moaned Mara, falling upon her
knees beside him.</p>

<p>The Confederate chief looked amazed.</p>

<p>“Who fired that shot?” he inquired.</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>At that moment, too, a new actor appeared
on the scene.</p>

<p>It was the scout, Boyd Wyman, who,
wounded, had remained at her home
while Mara had gone on her perilous
mission to Dalton.</p>

<p>He moved with the greatest difficulty,
but succeeded in reaching the doorway.</p>

<p>“What have you done?” he cried,
sharply.</p>

<p>“It was a dastardly shot!” he went on
as no one replied.</p>

<p>Mara was weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” queried the chief.</p>

<p>“Boyd Wyman; and I can vouch for
these people’s loyalty even as I can my
own.”</p>

<p>“It is Boyd Wyman!” averred one of
the soldiers. “They said he was
wounded and stopping up here.”</p>

<p>“Is the old man seriously hurt?” asked
the leader, moving in his seat uneasily.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the scout; “he has received
his death wound.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, for we meant him no
harm. Who is that beside him?”</p>

<p>“Mara Morland, his grand-daughter.
She has just returned from Dalton where
she has been to bear dispatches for me, as I
have got a chunk of lead in my leg and
cannot walk. But what means this piece
of unwarranted work? You have the old
man’s life to answer for.”</p>

<p>“We were after Cavalry Curt,” replied
the other, doggedly. “He has escaped,
and that chap by the old man helped
him to do it.”</p>

<p>“You know better; but go your way
and leave peaceful folks alone. You have
done mischief enough already.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t come out just as I expected.<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
Reckon though we’ll keep an eye on this
place. Sergeant Goodale, I will leave
ten men here under your charge as guards,
see that no one leaves it. You will
be held accountable for every life
here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, captain. Reckon we shan’t sleep
on our post.”</p>

<p>“I can trust you. Boyd Wyman, will
you go to Dalton with us?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t ride that distance to save
my life. Even if I could, I feel it my
duty to stay here.”</p>

<p>“Just as you choose.”</p>

<p>Without more delay, after detailing
ten of his followers to remain with Sergeant
Goodale, Captain Buck, with the
rest of his party, headed toward Dalton.</p>

</div>


<p>Johnston in fortifying himself at Dalton
had not overlooked the possible need
of an avenue of retreat or removal to
some other position.</p>

<p>Accordingly he had repaired the roads
leading into the different quarters of the
surrounding country; and wherever his
astute mind had deemed it expedient he
had opened new passages.</p>

<p>This enabled him to move about with
facility, divide or unite his forces as he
choose, and made his capture more difficult.</p>

<p>In the whole history of the war we
know of no instance where two officers
were so evenly and squarely pitted
against each other as far as individual
characteristics were concerned as were
Sherman and Johnston.</p>

<p>Either was as well prepared for the defeat
of his plans as for their success, nor
did victory unduly elate him.</p>

<p>Each had an eye to his surroundings
and was continually calling into acquisition
the advantage offered by the surface
of the country.</p>

<p>The march to Reseca was performed
with the ease and rapidity that marked
the Confederate commander’s entire campaign.</p>

<p>Cavalry Curt, we remember, had actually
entered the rebel ranks, and leaving
Mara Morland in her grief and hopeless
condition we must, in order to keep along
with the occurrence of events, turn to
narrate the scout’s checkered fortunes.</p>

<p>Warned of Sherman’s premeditated attack
by McPherson upon Reseca under
cover of an assault in Buzzard Roost led
by Thomas, and Schofield’s march toward
Dalton, Johnston had on the fifteenth of
May ordered Canty’s cavalry to that
place.</p>

<p>Soon after its arrival this skirmishing
brigade had become engaged with the
advance columns of the Northern troops
to be driven back.</p>

<p>McPherson thus unexpectedly met by
the foe, whom he had hoped to find asleep,
halted.</p>

<p>Thus the two forces were looking and
waiting for each other to move, neither
knowing the other’s strength, when on
the evening of the ninth three divisions
of Johnston’s infantry marched to the
succor of the threatened town.</p>

<p>The arrival of the re-inforcements was
the signal for rejoicing, and plans were
quickly laid for more hostile movements.</p>

<p>That the enemy’s position and actual
resources as to numbers, armament, etc.,
might be more definitely known a squad
of six under one Lieutenant Boggs was
detailed to reconnoiter the field.</p>

<p>Cavalry Curt to his infinite satisfaction
was one of the scouts.</p>

<p>Once outside the picket line the scouts
moved cautiously, yet swiftly forward, the
sense of each man strained to catch the
least sound or to detect the slightest
movement upon the night scene.</p>

<p>The sky was overcast with a thin lining
of clouds, so that it was quite dark in the
deeper forests. In a couple of hours the
moon would rise to dispel somewhat the
gloom.</p>

<p>As silently as so many shadows the
little party threaded the dim aisle of the
valley lying on the west of the town.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken and nothing
was heard to alarm them, until at last
they stood at the edge of a clearing of
several acres in extent.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Boggs motioning a halt,
they paused under the shadows of the
trees.</p>

<p>“I have an idea the Yanks are off to
the right,” he said, speaking for the first
time.</p>

<p>“More’n likely,” assented one of the
others.</p>

<p>Cavalry Curt started at the sound of
the last speaker’s voice. He was too well
schooled in his self-possession, however,
to betray any surprise, though he improved
the first opportunity to get a good,
square look at the man.</p>

<p>He had recognized the tone as that of
one whom he had at one time known.</p>

<p>The countenance was that of the person.</p>

<p>He had at one time belonged to Kearney’s
cavalry, but had disappeared
very suddenly and was supposed to have
been killed.</p>

<p>Curt’s most natural conclusion was
that he was acting a part as well as himself.</p>

<p>Though altered in appearance since<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
their last meeting he felt certain the
other would recognize him as soon as he
should get a fair view of his face.</p>

<p>Always careful to be on the safe side
the spy resolved not to discover his identity
to the other, but to maintain a careful
watch over himself.</p>

<p>He could not help feeling that the man
had deserted the Union cause.</p>

<p>In that case his own position was a
critical one.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe but we had better go
round the clearing,” declared Lieutenant
Boggs. “I kalkilate we have got to look
mighty sharp, for we are likely to run
on the Yanks at any step. Foller me.”</p>

<p>With this terse command he led the
way through the forest, the others following
closely upon his heels in Indian
fashion.</p>

<p>They had gone perhaps a quarter of a
mile in this way, when Lieutenant Boggs
paused abruptly.</p>

<p>Bending his head forward in a listening
attitude, after a minute’s anxious
wait, he said:</p>

<p>“I though I heard some step. But I
must have been mistaken. Isn’t that a
building over yonder on the swell?”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” replied one of his
companions.</p>

<p>“I have a mind to go up there.”</p>

<p>“My eye has been on that pine tree for
some time. What a view one could get
from its top! Let’s go up a little nearer
anyway.”</p>

<p>They soon came in plain sight of a
large, old-fashioned farm-house with outbuildings
adjoining, the whole looking
deserted and sadly out of repair.</p>

<p>The buildings stood on the crest of
quite an eminence of land.</p>

<p>On one side reaching nearly down to
the woods where they were concealed extended
a line of dense shrubbery.</p>

<p>A short distance from the house, its
dark, gigantic branches overhanging the
roof was a huge pine towering far above
any other tree in the vicinity.</p>

<p>It was this tree Lieutenant Boggs
wished to reach, knowing that from its
summit he could look down upon a wide
circle of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Without losing any time he swiftly, yet
silently advanced toward the forsaken
buildings, being careful to keep under the
cover of the trees.</p>

<p>His followers closely imitated his example,
and a few minutes later, without
having met with any renewed cause of
alarm, they gained the summit.</p>

<p>Under the giant pine Lieutenant Boggs
ordered a halt.</p>

<p>“One of us had better climb the tree.
If I mistake not, from its top the camp
of the Yanks will be in plain view. You
are the man to do it,” he concluded, turning
to Cavalry Curt.</p>

<p>The words in themselves were innocent
enough, but they were no sooner spoken
than the scout instantly interpreted a
double meaning.</p>

<p>He saw Lieutenant Boggs and the deserter
exchange significant glances, and
all at once it flashed through his mind
that his identity had been discovered!</p>

<p>He had been betrayed!</p>

<p>It was evidently a part of the plans of
his foes to get him into the tree, where
he would be at their mercy.</p>

<p>A hurried glance around showed that
there was no way for him to escape.</p>

<p>He must either climb the tree or refuse
to obey the order. In the latter case he
would only hasten the crisis without
bringing any especial benefit to himself.</p>

<p>He was in a tight place.</p>

</div>


<p>“Come, why don’t you obey orders?”
growled Lieutenant Boggs, as Cavalry
Curt hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>“Danged if I see just how I am going
to get up to that first limb,” muttered
the scout. “I never was much of a
climber,” and he started around the tree,
obviously to find a way to ascend its
trunk, but really to test the intentions
of his companions.</p>

<p>No sooner had he moved than their
rifles were half-raised and they seemed
ready to spring upon him. He no longer
doubted their purpose. Neither did he
delay further in his course of action.</p>

<p>“We’ll show you a way to get your
lubberly carcass up there if you don’t try
for yourself pretty lively,” exclaimed the
lieutenant, impatiently.</p>

<p>“If some of you will just give me a
boost I guess I can get up here,” declared
Curt.</p>

<p>With the assistance of a couple of the
others he was enabled to reach the first
branch when he slowly drew himself up
until he had gained its support.</p>

<p>Glancing over his shoulder he saw that
the squad had covered him with their
guns, and that Lieutenant Boggs was
smiling triumphantly.</p>

<p>Without seeming to notice their hostile
movement, however, Cavalry Curt continued
his ascent of the pine.</p>

<p>Feeling confident of their game the
Confederates allowed him to go up higher
until his form began to fade from sight.</p>

<p>“We can take him as he comes down,”
said Boggs. “Look sharp for him,
boys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>This was spoken in an undertone
which of course did not reach the scout’s
ears, though he knew well enough their
intentions.</p>

<p>Higher and higher he rapidly ascended
the tree, until at last he was near the
top.</p>

<p>Parting the thick branches he gazed
out upon the surrounding country scene
for several miles in the clear starlight.
Had it been daylight he might have seen
distinctly a wide panorama of scenery.</p>

<p>As he had expected to do he gazed
upon the tents of an encampment of the
Federal troops. He knew well enough
it was McPherson’s corps lying in wait,
undecided as yet whether to move boldly
upon Reseca or to retreat.</p>

<p>The forces were but a few miles away
and fixing the direction in his mind he
began to look around him for some avenue
of escape, knowing that he had but
a few minutes in which to act.</p>

<p>Peering down through the matted
branches he saw that the Confederates
were listlessly waiting his movements.
At the least cause for alarm they would
be active enough, though evidently they
felt certain of their prey.</p>

<p>As we have already told the pine stood
near to the house, so near in fact that
Cavalry Curt had noticed that its
branches touched the building.</p>

<p>Particularly were they thick together
and long at a point objective to the
chamber windows. Here was where the
scout hoped to escape.</p>

<p>Without stopping to take more than a
hasty survey from his lofty perch Curt,
leaving his slouched hat so it might be
seen by those below, cautiously began to
descend, hugging closely to the tree.</p>

<p>Swiftly yet silently he retraced his
course until he stood on the branch that,
reaching around the corner of the dwelling,
had boldly pushed its way through
one of the windows.</p>

<p>Hearing nothing as yet from his enemies
to alarm him, he glided out along
the branch concealed by the matted
growth of boughs above and below.</p>

<p>“Helloa!” called out Lieutenant Boggs,
cautiously, when he was about midway
in the passage, “what do you see?”</p>

<p>Of course Curt made no reply&mdash;only
quickened his progress knowing that his
time would soon be up.</p>

<p>“I say where are you?” called out
Boggs a little louder, as he listened in
vain for an answer to his first call.</p>

<p>“Hang the fool! why don’t he speak!”
muttered the officer. Then louder than
before he called out:</p>

<p>“Are you going to keep us here all
night? Come down at once.”</p>

<p>At this moment Curt’s hand touched
the window-sill, when with the agility of
a cat he noiselessly drew himself forward
allowing the branch to sway back to
its normal position as gently as possible.</p>

<p>Still the Confederate received no reply
to his appeal and he began to grow first
uneasy, then furious.</p>

<p>“He is clean, clear to the top,” declared
one of his followers, “I can just
see his head between the branches.
P’raps he don’t hear you, for he don’t
move.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send a chunk of lead up there if
he don’t stir pretty soon,” growled Boggs.
“Reckon that’ll fetch him.”</p>

<p>The night seemed unusually quiet, and
not a sound followed his words.</p>

<p>Curt had gained the house and stood
within its walls.</p>

<p>“Look here, you infernal Yank!” called
out Boggs louder than before, “if you
don’t come down we’ll riddle you with
bullets! We have waited long enough
and its time for you to know that your
game is up!”</p>

<p>Of course he received no reply and he
stamped the ground madly, regardless
of the danger he was courting, forgetting
that he might have enemies within hearing.</p>

<p>“He don’t move,” whispered the soldier.
“Shall I fire at him?”</p>

<p>“Curses upon our stupidity, no. It
would wake up the whole army of
Yanks. Let me speak to the dog once
more!”</p>

<p>Again he called out to the scout with,
as might be expected, no better result.</p>

<p>“One of you must go up there,” said
Lieutenant Boggs. “Who will do it?”</p>

<p>Not one of the little group volunteered
to do so.</p>

<p>“He’s a desperate chap,” ventured one;
“and as he’s above he’s going to have us
at a disadvantage. I don’t care to tackle
him alone, I allow.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” retorted Boggs, “you are a
coward.”</p>

<p>He shirked the undertaking himself,
however.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be safer for three
to go up,” he said a minute later. “Can
the dog have mistrusted our plan?”</p>

<p>“Hark! what was that?” exclaimed
one of the soldiers as a loud crash from
within the house broke the stillness of
the night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">TURNING THE TABLES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In a moment the little squad were on
the alert.</p>

<p>No sound, however, followed the crash
which seemed like the concussion of a
falling body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p>“Some one is in the house!” whispered
Boggs, whose stock of courage never
was great, was fast leaving him.</p>

<p>“Let’s go in and see,” ventured one of
the others with less fear.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t leave the tree without a
guard to see that the Yank does not get
off. Jones and Monkton, do you keep a
close watch over that spy while the rest
of us explore the old building. Come on,
boys; and mind that you keep your eyes
open.”</p>

<p>With these words he led the way toward
the open door.</p>

<p>It was dark and still within. Not
without many misgivings did Lieutenant
Boggs enter the deserted abode.
Every footstep gave back a loud, creaking
noise and he fancied that all kinds of
creatures were in the place. A bat,
started from its retreat by the nocturnal
disturbers of its peace, flew uncomfortably
near to his head.</p>

<p>He crossed the first apartment closely
followed by the others, to enter an adjoining
room even darker than the first
if that were possible.</p>

<p>Unknown to them the eagle eyes of
the scout were watching their movements
from the second floor.</p>

<p>Alike unseen and unheard by either
friend or foe another with catlike steps
was tracking the Confederates.</p>

<p>Then as he crossed the threshold of the
inner apartment the scout caught sight
of his tall, powerful form. He started
with surprise for even in the semi-darkness
he had recognized the Wizard
Scout!</p>

<p>Here then was help he had little expected&mdash;an
arm that was worth a dozen
ordinary men.</p>

<p>Until then Curt had thought only of
escape for himself. Finding that he had
an ally in the field, a bold, daring scheme
entered his head.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Boggs and his party, however,
had come to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>“Hist!” exclaimed he. “I heard something
move in the corner yonder.”</p>

<p>His followers quickly came to a standstill,
when an oppressive silence hung
over the lonely scene.</p>

<p>“Man or devil, come forth!” challenged
Boggs, trying to appear calm though he
was trembling with fear.</p>

<p>No reply was made by word or move.</p>

<p>The Wizard Scout stood in the darkness
grimly watching them.</p>

<p>“’Twas nothing!” exclaimed the boldest
of the squad. “The first sound we
heard was but the branches of the pine
striking against the side of the house.
Let’s get out of this. We are losing valuable
time. Hark! Jones is calling for
us.”</p>

<p>“Yes; we have fooled here long
enough,” assented Boggs. “Here seems
to be a door leading out at the end of
the house. Let’s go out this way.”</p>

<p>Glad to escape from the place, the Confederates
hastily passed out into the
night.</p>

<p>Had they looked back by the light
streaming in through the door they had
opened they might have discovered the
tall figure of Old Fatality standing in the
background, a smile upon his bronze
visage.</p>

<p>They left the door open.</p>

<p>As soon as satisfied that they were beyond
hearing Curt spoke in a low tone
to the mysterious scout who without looking
up or betraying any surprise motioned
for him to descend the stairs.</p>

<p>A minute later Curt stood beside him.</p>

<p>“This is a glad meeting on my part,”
whispered he. “I was wishing I had
some one to help me.”</p>

<p>“I mistrusted it,” replied the unknown,
“so I followed you up here. Do you intend
to capture the rebels?”</p>

<p>“If possible.”</p>

<p>“Good. Let’s get where we can see
what they are doing now.”</p>

<p>Noiselessly crossing the room they
looked cautiously out upon the handful
of perplexed Confederates, who were
grouped under the pine discussing their
next move.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t lose that infernal spy,”
declared Boggs. “Has he moved yet,
Jones?”</p>

<p>“Nary a bit.”</p>

<p>“Queer. Some of us’ll have to dislodge
the fellow. Who of you’ll climb up
there?”</p>

<p>“And get riddled for our pains!”
growled one.</p>

<p>“Bah! it’s got to be done,” said Boggs.
“Strange the fool don’t know enough to
come down.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go for one,” volunteered Jones.</p>

<p>“I reckon I ain’t afeerd to go with
you,” supplemented Bronson.</p>

<p>“Nor me,” added another.</p>

<p>“And me,” shouted a fourth.</p>

<p>“Enough,” said Boggs.</p>

<p>“While you four are dislodging the
game, Sperry and myself will see that he
don’t get away. Where is he, Jones,
anyway? Hang me if I don’t believe he
has got off already!”</p>

<p>“No; he’s there yet,” affirmed Jones.
“See, there’s his head just to the right
of that big limb with the crows’ nest
boughs.”</p>

<p>“Well, climb; we’ve lost time enough
already.”</p>

<p>“You had better keep your eye on
him and the moment he moves warn us,”
said Jones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, cover him with your gun, Sperry;
and at the first move shoot him.”</p>

<p>This last was spoken loud enough for
the fugitive to hear even were he further
away than was supposed.</p>

<p>Nothing in shape of a reply was vouchsafed.</p>

<p>“Hanged if I believe he’s there,” said
Boggs.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll show you in less’n no time.
Come on, boys.”</p>

<p>Without further delay Jones began the
ascent of the tree, the others following
upon his heels.</p>

<p>The smile upon the Wizard Scout’s
grim visage broadened as he and Curt
watched the Confederates.</p>

<p>“There’s one apiece for us!” he whispered.</p>

<p>“And you may have old shoulder-straps,”
added Curt. “Come, why wait
longer?”</p>

<p>The four had gained the branches
of the pine and were cautiously ascending
toward the supposed refuge of the
scout.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Boggs and his companion
were intently watching&mdash;the first the
progress of his men, the other the motionless
object in the top of the tree
which he fancied was the hiding fugitive.</p>

<p>As silently as shadows the scouts crept
upon the unsuspecting foe.</p>

<p>Old Fatality was unarmed, as far as
weapons of war were concerned, but his
long, talon-like fingers worked convulsively
as if eager to clutch the throat of
his victim.</p>

<p>The butts of a pair of revolvers protruded
from the belt of Cavalry Curt.</p>

<p>In the midst of their anxious watch
the Confederates felt themselves seized
in grasps of iron and in spite of their futile
resistance they were borne to the
earth.</p>

<p>Before either of them could cry out, a
hand was placed over their mouths and
a low voice whispered in their ears the
single word.</p>

<p>“Surrender!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the four were cautiously
approaching the top of the pine wondering
that their prey should keep so quiet.</p>

<p>Then as they drew nearer and no form
of man took shape among the branches
they began to anticipate the hoax played
upon them.</p>

<p>“No one is there,” whispered Jones,
with a breath of relief.</p>

<p>“He must be there somewhere!”</p>

<p>“He ain’t. He’s got away somehow.”</p>

<p>“Impossible.”</p>

<p>They were soon satisfied, however, that
such was the case.</p>

<p>“A pretty go!” muttered the leader.
“I see now, it was him we heard in the
building. Get down there lively for
we may not be too late to get him yet.”</p>

<p>They saw two men under the tree as
they had left them, and did not dream
they were others than Boggs and Sperry
their companions, until the clear tones
of Curt called out:</p>

<p>“Hold! the tables have turned and
you are Union prisoners! Move at the
peril of your lives. Our rifles cover you!”</p>

<p>Never were four men more completely
surprised. However, they were fairly
caught.</p>

<p>Finding they could do no better they
descended one by one to surrender themselves
as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Boggs swore at a fearful
rate until threatened with a gag when he
relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>When Curt had securely bound the last
of the squad, the scouts resolved to march
with them to the camp of McPherson.</p>

<p>Who can blame them if they felt a bit
proud of their capture, while the Confederates
gnashed their teeth with rage, inwardly
vowing that they would get even
with their doughty captors.</p>

<p>Leaving the scouts to reach the Northern
lines with their prize in safety, we
must turn to follow the fortunes of others
of our actors in this drama of war.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">WAS IT TREASON?</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Sad, anxious days to Mara Morland followed
her return from that eventful trip
to Dalton.</p>

<p>Her grandfather sank fast from the
wound he received that morning and it
soon became evident, even to Mara,
that he had but a few hours to live.</p>

<p>“I do not mind dying,” he said. “I
have lived far beyond the age of man,
and I have felt I must soon be called
home. It is for you that I fear, my child.
I dare not contemplate your fate.”</p>

<p>She tried to brighten his spirits with
words of cheer.</p>

<p>He slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>“I see but one course for you to follow,”
he said finally. “Harry cannot
offer you any protection, and to remain
here would be rashness. I see well
enough now that the old place will be
devastated ere long. Ay, I had rather
die than to live to see that. And it is
surely coming. Mara, are you listening,
child?”</p>

<p>“Yes, grandpa.”</p>

<p>“You had better go to your Cousin
Randolph’s in Woodsville. You will be
safer there. I wish Harry was here.
Brave boy, I never shall see him any<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
more. Tell him that I thought of him in
my last moments.”</p>

<p>He said but little more after this and
the hue of life faded fast from his countenance.</p>

<p>He had lain a long time motionless,
when there was a nervous twitching at
his mouth and his closed eyes opened.</p>

<p>“Mara, where are you?”</p>

<p>“Here, dear grandpa.”</p>

<p>“See, his brow lightens with the touch
of death,” whispered one of the guards to
the others.</p>

<p>“Mara,” cried the dying man, huskily,
“I have had such a vision, and things
appeared so different. I see our mistake
now. The flag of the South will yet trail
in the dust and the stars and stripes in
brighter luster than at Yorktown or
New Orleans will wave over the country
three times saved. It is right. ’Twas
the same starry banner that my father
fought for under the gallant Sumpter,
and which I followed under General
Jackson at New Orleans. Long may it
wave, to glory undim&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>With the last word quivering upon his
lips, his upraised arm fell, and his voice
died to a low gasp. A minute later his
spirit had fled from the scenes of war.</p>

<p>The guards had looked upon each
other with wonder as they listened to
the words that were freighted with so
much of patriotism, so much of evil to at
least one of the listeners&mdash;the innocent
maiden whose fair countenance was wet
with tears.</p>

<p>“Treason! treason!” they cried as in
one voice. “We ought to have hung
the old traitor! Let’s make an example
of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold!” exclaimed Boyd Wyman from
his couch in an adjoining apartment.
“Do nothing rash. They were but the
ravings of a wandering mind. Let him
rest in death. For the girl’s sake be
merciful.”</p>

<p>The scout’s words were not in vain.</p>

<p>The soldiers curbed their anger and the
dead was left in peace.</p>

<p>The sight of the poor girl’s grief moved
them to sympathy and kindness.</p>

<p>Under their directions the body was
prepared for a decent burial and finally,
a day later, was borne to its last rest.</p>

<p>A few of the many slaves once owned
by Colonel Morland were left at the old
plantation and these shed genuine tears
of sorrow.</p>

<p>He had been a kind master.</p>

<p>Two of the negroes called Pete and
Dinah were very thoughtful to Mara in
her bereavement.</p>

<p>Boyd Wyman’s wounds were growing
more painful. Inflammation had set in so
that his case was becoming critical.</p>

<p>Mara was a brave girl and controlling
her grief to a wonderful extent she did
all in her power for the wounded scout.</p>

<p>The shifting scenes of war move rapidly.</p>

<p>A few hours after the simple funeral
of Colonel Morland, two horsemen appeared
in front of the house.</p>

<p>The leader was Lieutenant Logan.</p>

<p>“I must see the prisoner,” he said. “I
bear an order and a message from General
B&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>The sight of the gallant soldier was a
relief to Mara.</p>

<p>Perhaps he came with good tidings.</p>

<p>But as he stopped to speak to one of
the guards and listened to his speech,
the officer’s face grew dark.</p>

<p>He came into the house a minute later.</p>

<p>“I am pained to find you in such a
sorry plight, Miss Morland,” was his
greeting.</p>

<p>“Only say that you have come to end
this terrible farce and I will not complain,”
she replied.</p>

<p>“I have,” he said, quickly. “I have
interceded for you and at the first opportunity
have come to offer you your
release.”</p>

<p>She failed to understand his meaning.</p>

<p>“You have been ordered to be brought
to Dalton upon the charge of treason.”</p>

<p>“Treason;” she repeated, with quivering
lips, “who dares to accuse me of
that?”</p>

<p>“Alas! Mara, circumstances are against
you. Your grandfather’s dying words
have a terrible signification. I fear it
will go hard with you.”</p>

<p>“But Harry will intercede for me. I
will go to him.”</p>

<p>“Stop, Mara; that is the worst feature
in your case. I am sorry to tell you, but
the truth must be told.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” she cried, catching him
by the arm as he paused.</p>

<p>He turned aside to escape her piercing
gaze.</p>

<p>“Must I tell you,” he stammered.
“Harry has been dishonored. His commission
has been taken from him and he
has returned to the ranks under probation.”</p>

<p>“Harry in dishonor!” she cried, clasping
her hands. “You cannot mean it,
Lieutenant Logan.”</p>

<p>“It was a hard blow for me, Mara, for
Harry is a fine fellow, and his disgrace
came like a thunder-clap. Upon his return
from Buzzard’s Roost Gap he was
arrested for being accessory to the escape
of Cavalry Curt and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is not so!” she cried, wildly. “I
will go to Dalton at once. I can and will
save him.”</p>

<p>“Nay, Mara, you let your grief run<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
away with your reason. He is safe at
present.”</p>

<p>“But I must see him.”</p>

<p>“You do not realize how impossible
that is, could you do him any good. He
has gone to Reseca with a body of troops
ordered there to its defense.”</p>

<p>“Gone to Reseca,” she repeated; “and
as a common soldier&mdash;ay, more than
that, a soldier in disgrace!”</p>

<p>“Be brave, Mara, and it shall end well.
Your own welfare claims our attention
now. You must leave this place at once
if you value your life.”</p>

<p>“And yet you just said that I could
not.”</p>

<p>He had turned away to pause at one of
the windows&mdash;turned away purposely
that he might speak without being heard
by Boyd Wyman.</p>

<p>Mechanically she followed him.</p>

<p>“Mara,” he said, in a low tone, “I have
come up here on a trumped up errand
that I might see you. I have come to
save you, even at great risk to myself,
if you will accept my terms.”</p>

<p>“Explain yourself, Lieutenant Logan.”</p>

<p>“Do you not understand how much I
love you? I cannot tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stopped him with a wave of her
hand.</p>

<p>“If you have nothing else to say, Lieutenant
Logan, this interview might as
well come to an end. I respect you as a
friend, but I do not love you.”</p>

<p>“But you would learn to, Mara.
Promise to be my wife as soon as this
war is over, and I will have you taken to
a place of safety this very night. Do
you promise?” he asked, earnestly.</p>

<p>“If you really loved me you would do
so without exacting a promise that you
know would break my heart.”</p>

<p>“You do not quite understand me.
Were it not for that Yankee&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Something in her looks caused him to
stop.</p>

<p>“You refuse?” he continued with a look
that she would never forget.</p>

<p>“Yes; I would not purchase life upon
such conditions.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry. I hope you will never
regret this course. I must go now. Do
not blame me when the worst comes. If
you change your mind I will fly to your
rescue the moment you send for me. I
am not so bad at heart as you think,
only I had rather die than yield to a Yankee.
Good-day.”</p>

<p>With a few parting words of encouragement
to Boyd Wyman he went out of
the house and mounting his horse rode
away.</p>

<p>“Did he give you any reason for hope?”
asked Wyman, as Mara returned to the
side of his couch.</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“It is infamous!” exclaimed the scout,
fiercely. “He told you of your brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Poor boy; in his present state of mind,
I tremble for his safety.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A FRIEND IN NEED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A little before sunset on the same afternoon
as Mara was watching by the side
of the wounded scout, Black Dinah entered
the room and glancing cautiously
around went up to her.</p>

<p>“Please, missus, come inter t’other
room,” she whispered. “You’re wanted
bad.”</p>

<p>The speaker was greatly agitated, and
she rolled her eyes and pulled her apron
and clasped and unclasped her hands in
a way that told of more than she dared
or could tell.</p>

<p>Mara hesitated.</p>

<p>“Be spry ’fore sojers see.”</p>

<p>Wondering what she could want, Mara
followed her out of the room.</p>

<p>As they were allowed to go about the
lower story of the house at liberty, the
soldiers if they saw them thought nothing
strange.</p>

<p>Dinah’s teeth chattered and her eyes
showed their whites in a startling way.</p>

<p>Mara came near uttering a cry of surprise
as she entered the apartment to
find a stranger standing in the center of
the floor.</p>

<p>His hand was upraised enjoining silence.</p>

<p>“I am a friend,” he said quickly, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>“’Fore de lawd, he mus’ be a sperit,”
chattered Dinah, “No immortal man
c’u’d a got hyer and not a bref uv a soul
to see ’im&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush!” warned the man.</p>

<p>He was of middle age, medium in
stature, and with a well-knit frame.</p>

<p>His cleanly shaven face was frank and
handsome. Perhaps his eyes were a bit
too bright, but on the whole he seemed
every inch a gentleman.</p>

<p>He was in citizen’s dress and as far as
was seen he carried no weapons.</p>

<p>All this Mara saw at a glance.</p>

<p>“Are we likely to be interrupted by
the soldiers?”</p>

<p>“Not for a short time,” she replied, imitating
his tone. “What is your errand,
sir?”</p>

<p>“I will state it briefly,” he answered.
“A body of horsemen are even now on
the road from Dalton to effect your capture.
General Johnston is calling in all
of the skirmishing parties he has sent<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
out so as to concentrate his forces as
much as possible. He cannot afford to
keep any soldiers here longer. You will
be taken to Dalton, or what I fear most,
will be shot as a traitor as soon as you
are dragged from the house. I have come
to save you.”</p>

<p>All this was spoken so rapidly that
Mara could only listen in mute amazement.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” she faltered at last.</p>

<p>“Don’t be surprised at the mention of
my name,” he replied. “I am the
Wizard Scout.”</p>

<p>In spite of his warning she could hardly
suppress a cry of amazement.</p>

<p>“I knew you would be surprised,” he
declared. “I was in disguise when you
saw me before, as I am now. But that
makes me none the less your friend. I
know of all that has transpired since we
parted and knowing your peril, I have
come to help you escape.”</p>

<p>“How?” she asked.</p>

<p>“By flight. We must lose no time
either. The troops will be here in half
an hour. If you have no place you can
go to, I will guide you to a friend of
mine.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do,” she declared.
“All this is so sudden and terrible.
I want to go to Dalton to see Harry.”</p>

<p>“But he is not there. He went to
Reseca. To give you more confidence in
what I promise to do here is a line I have
brought you from Cavalry Curt.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he unscrewed one of his
buttons from his coat to produce a small
piece of paper disclosed beneath its cap.</p>

<p>Mara took the missive with a trembling
hand.</p>

<p>She read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Morland</span>:&mdash;Learning of
your danger I am anxious to lend you my
assistance toward escape. But it is impossible
for me to do so. Thus I send my
friend whom you have met before, knowing
that he can do much better than I.
You can trust him. I escaped safely
from the enemy, thanks to the friend
who will help you now.</p>

<p class="ir1"><span style="padding-right:1em">“Respectfully,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">C. Remington</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“I will do as you think best,” she said,
handing him back the paper.</p>

<p>“Then get ready to leave as soon as
possible. Have you any place you wish
to go?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to my cousins in Woodsville.”</p>

<p>“Very well. But perhaps you had
better go back now as your absence may
create a suspicion. Boyd Wyman is still
here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It may be best to speak to him. He
is to be trusted in your behalf. While
you are gone I will plan a way of escape.
Return soon.”</p>

<p>As Mara returned to the side of Wyman’s
couch she saw by the actions of the
soldiers that she had appeared none too
soon to allay their suspicions.</p>

<p>Whatever the scout may have thought
he remained quiet.</p>

<p>As she gazed upon his pale face bearing
so plainly the evidence of his suffering
it occurred to her as an act of selfishness
and cowardice to leave him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless as soon as the soldiers
turned away, she whispered to him of
the presence of the strange man in the
adjoining room and what he had told her.</p>

<p>If Boyd Wyman was surprised he did
not show it by look or word.</p>

<p>“The Wizard Scout, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but how could he have got
here?”</p>

<p>“Nothing seems impossible with him.
You could not have had a better friend
come to your rescue. I am glad he has
come. Trust in him and you will have
little to fear. You had better get ready
at once.”</p>

<p>“But what will become of you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall get along all right,” he replied,
carelessly. “Remember I shall
be among friends. I wish you god-speed
in your escape. If we never meet again,
remember Boyd Wyman will never forget
your kindness to him. There, you had
better return to your friend as there is
no time to be lost.”</p>

<p>Not without some reluctance Mara returned
to the Wizard Scout.</p>

<p>“I am glad you have come,” he said.
“I can think of but one way to escape.
You will have to personate the
colored servant who was here. I suppose
she is allowed to go about the house at
will and even out of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. She goes to the spring for
water often.”</p>

<p>“I mistrusted as much. Now isn’t
there one I can personate?”</p>

<p>After a moment’s thought she answered
as her countenance brightened:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; there is Pete. And they are
together much.”</p>

<p>“They are just the ones then. We
shall not have to separate. If you can
manage to get some of their clothing I
will arrange the rest. I am almost prepared
for such a disguise. I was a darky
all day yesterday. The day before an
Irishman.”</p>

<p>Mara went out to find Dinah.</p>

<p>She was in the kitchen and alone.</p>

<p>A few words explained all to the faithful
servant, at least, all that was necessary
to tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>“’Deed I will, missus.”</p>

<p>“And you must keep out of sight as
soon as I tell you to.”</p>

<p>“’Deed I will, missus. Is it fer yees to
git away from ’em whurrible sojers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dinah. Be quick about it, only
don’t let them see you.”</p>

<p>“’Deed I won’t, missus.”</p>

<p>Mara returned to the wounded scout
while Dinah was getting the garments.</p>

<p>“Has he hit upon a plan?” he asked.</p>

<p>Then as she explained the plan he nodded
his head in approval.</p>

<p>“It is best.”</p>

<p>Mara was too anxious to remain idle
long, so she soon returned to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Dinah seemed greatly agitated.</p>

<p>“What is it, Dinah?”</p>

<p>“’Fore the lawd, it am s’prisin’! Fust
dar ain’t no man; den I’se fin’ white, and
jess now w’en I tote dem fings dar what
s’pose I find. A man black&mdash;yah, black
as Pete. Shure nuff&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush! some one is coming.”</p>

<p>In a louder tone:</p>

<p>“Aren’t those cakes about done, Dinah&mdash;You
seem slower than ever.”</p>

<p>“Deed, I is,” muttered Dinah, turning
to the neglected cakes.</p>

<p>One of the guards entered the room, but
seeing nothing suspicious he returned to
the front of the house.</p>

<p>Perhaps they were expecting the troops
from Dalton for they were anxiously
watching the road that wound like a
huge serpent in that direction.</p>

<p>Not a second of the next five minutes
was lost by our friends.</p>

<p>At the end of that time had one looked
for Mara Morland and the Wizard Scout
he would have found them transformed
into identical counterparts of Pete and
Dinah.</p>

<p>Mara had bidden farewell to Boyd Wyman,
and had told Pete and Dinah to
keep out of sight.</p>

<p>“I think we are ready to start now,”
said the Wizard Scout, lowly. “Be
brave and do not lose your self-possession
let come what may. Follow
me.”</p>

<p>Reaching the kitchen they saw one of
the soldiers in the next room.</p>

<p>As unconcernedly, however, as if their
errand was a real one the scout took up a
couple of buckets and handed one to
Mara.</p>

<p>“Reckon we’se go to der sp’ing fer
watah, honey,” he said in imitation
of Pete’s maudlin tone.</p>

<p>As he opened the door a body of horsemen
came in sight of the house, riding at
a smart canter.</p>

<p>“Run long wid yer, old gal.”</p>

<p>Under his breath he said:</p>

<p>“I am afraid we are too late!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE FUGITIVES’ FLIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Hold on there, you black imps; where
are you going?” thundered the soldier.</p>

<p>Mara’s heart almost stopped its beating.</p>

<p>“To de sp’ing, massa,” answered the
scout, coolly.</p>

<p>“Seems to me you go mighty often.”</p>

<p>“De watah done git roominated wid
bad taste, massa. ’Sides Dinah done spill
sum un dat las bucket.”</p>

<p>“Go along; and see that you don’t
waste any time.”</p>

<p>“Yas, massa.”</p>

<p>As the scout and Mara started down
the well-worn path to the spring from
the back door, the horsemen reined up
in front of the house.</p>

<p>“Ho there, Sergeant Howe, we have
come for that troublesome bird of yours,”
cried the foremost.</p>

<p>“None too soon to suit me either,
Lieutenant Bradley. You will find her
near at hand. She is with Wyman.”</p>

<p>But they found the wounded scout
alone.</p>

<p>“Miss Morland was here a few minutes
ago,” said Wyman. “She will probably
be back directly. You might as well
wait here.”</p>

<p>“Precious little time have we to wait,”
growled the officer.</p>

<p>He did wait, however, a few minutes,
time that Boyd Wyman knew well was
precious to the fugitives.</p>

<p>“This won’t do!” exclaimed the other,
soon losing his patience. “Find her,
men&mdash;at once.”</p>

<p>A search for the missing maiden was instantly
begun, but to the surprise and
chagrin of the soldiers could not be
found.</p>

<p>“She can’t be far away,” reiterated
Wyman. “She must have hidden somewhere
in the house when she saw you
coming.”</p>

<p>“By heavens! we will show her the
fate of traitors inside of five minutes!”
vociferated the anxious officer. “Summon
the servants.”</p>

<p>The chattering slaves were quickly
found huddling together in a scared
group in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Pete and Dinah according to instructions
had come out of their hiding-places
soon after the fugitives had left.</p>

<p>They were faithful to their promise,
and the enraged Confederates could
learn no trace of their missing prey.</p>

<p>“I know of one way to drive her from
her retreat,” said the leader, grimly. “I
will do it, now.”</p>

<p>“Here, men, some of you, Lake and
Woodstaff, bear Boyd Wyman out of the<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
house. Sergeant Howe, see that the house
is surrounded and no one escapes. I will
show that girl a trick she little dreams of.”</p>

<p>While his orders were being carried
out, Lieutenant Bradley, with his own
hands, set fire to the house.</p>

<p>“That will drive her out,” he muttered,
with a look of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Boyd Wyman uttered a groan as he
witnessed the fiendish work.</p>

<p>We can well anticipate the result.</p>

<p>“Curse her!” yelled the Confederate
as he looked in vain for the appearance
of his victim; “she is spunky though!”</p>

<p>Then as the flames began to decrease
and the walls fell he turned away.</p>

<p>“The fire has saved us further trouble.
Come, men, follow me back to Dalton.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the scout and Mara were
pursuing their flight.</p>

<p>The path to the spring wound down
the hill, and after going a few rods the
view from the house was obscured by a
thick growth of bushes.</p>

<p>“We have no further use for these
buckets and little need we should encumber
ourselves with them longer,” he
said. “We must get as far as possible
from here before our flight is discovered.”</p>

<p>Mara followed him in silence.</p>

<p>Darkness was fast coming on which
promised to favor them in their escape.</p>

<p>The country was broken and their
progress was necessarily slow, however.</p>

<p>They heard the cries of their enemies
once, but beyond that nothing was seen
or known of them, until they had gone
a mile or more, when looking back Mara
uttered a low exclamation.</p>

<p>Her companion turned quickly in alarm
when he saw a bright light in the distance.</p>

<p>“They have set fire to the house!” she
exclaimed in a tremulous voice, as the
night scene was lit with a brighter glare,
while the flames leaped higher and
higher.</p>

<p>“See! I can distinguish the forms of
some of them by the light of the flames!”
she continued clutching him by his arm.
“Oh, my poor home.”</p>

<p>“Do not despair,” he said, encouragingly,
as they watched the fire. “That
tells that they are not following us. But
we must not lose any time. Come, we
must go on.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly she turned from the sight
of the burning building.</p>

<p>“Homeless and a fugitive!” she murmured.
“God have pity on me now.”</p>

<p>“Do not lose courage,” he said. “Remember
you are not alone in your grief.
All that I held dear sleeps to-night beneath
the Confederate sod.”</p>

<p>Then as if wishing to change the subject
he said, pointing down the valley:</p>

<p>“That must be our course. On our
right is Dalton, on our left, Buzzard’s
Gap. We must look sharp or we shall
run into the clutches of foes before we
know it. These disguises must be cast
off at the first possible moment. Now
that they have served their purpose we
could not be in more dangerous costumes,
for were we discovered we should be mistaken
for escaping slaves and shot down
without a word.”</p>

<p>These remarks were spoken in a low
tone for no one knew better than the
speaker the peril that lay before them.</p>

<p>In the very heart of the enemy’s country,
overrun by their troops, escape
seemed well-nigh impossible.</p>

<p>The scout spoke but a few times for
the next hour and nothing occurred to
check their flight.</p>

<p>Coming to a stream he proposed
that they should wash the black from
their faces and hands and discard the
garbs that they wore over their own.</p>

<p>This was but a short undertaking and
Mara soon appeared as herself glad to escape
the uncomfortable disguise.</p>

<p>To her surprise her companion produced
a wig and a set of long, white
whiskers. Then with a few deft touches
he was transformed into an old man.</p>

<p>“A staff, and my disguise is complete,
is it not?” he said with a smile. “This
is a favorite character of mine. Remember
now you are to pass as my daughter.”</p>

<p>“I do not wonder they call you the
Wizard Scout,” declared Mara, as she
looked on with amazement.</p>

<p>“You will wonder less when you know
me better, my darter,” assuming the role
of his new relationship. “But I must
put these old duds out of the way.”</p>

<p>“Hark!” she exclaimed, “what is that
firing?” as the sound of firearms suddenly
awoke the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>“The two armies are having a battle.
From the direction I should judge that
Schofield has attacked the flank of Johnston’s
army. Ah, he will give the graycoats
a hard tussle.”</p>

<p>“I think you are a Northern man.”</p>

<p>“My sympathies are for the Union,
and while I can lift this good right arm
of mine I will stand in its defense.”</p>

<p>He spoke with great earnestness.</p>

<p>“You forget that I am a rebel.”</p>

<p>“No more than you did when you saved
the life of Cavalry Curt. But have done
with talk. I believe I hear a body of
horsemen coming this way.”</p>

<p>“And they are coming at a smart canter,”
said Mara, as the sounds grew rapidly
plainer.</p>

<p>“It must be a skirmishing squad of
Johnston’s. We can’t be far from the
road.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>“Do you think they will see us?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Not if we can help it. We must look
round for a hiding-place though. Ha! I
believe yonder thicket is just the place
for us. Let’s see about it.”</p>

<p>Upon reaching the spot they found
that a huge tree had been uptorn there,
its matted roots, filled in with earth and
overgrown with a thick mass of bushes
forming as impenetrable a cover as could
be desired.</p>

<p>“Just the place for us,” declared the
scout, “and we are near enough, so that
we can see the horsemen as they pass.
Crawl in and make yourself as comfortable
as possible,” parting the bushes so
that she had little difficulty in gaining
the retreat.</p>

<p>“No one would mistrust you were
there,” he said, as he allowed the undergrowth
to resume its natural position,
“I can’t see you, I swear.”</p>

<p>“But aren’t you going to remain?” she
asked uneasily, as he seemed about to
move away.</p>

<p>“No; keep perfectly still until I return,
and above all don’t get alarmed. I am
going out to salute ’em fellows. They
are almost here, too, I’m going to play on
’em. Just to keep up my reputation.”</p>

<p>Before Mara could speak he stepped
boldly out from the growth into the path
of the oncoming horsemen.</p>

<p>Parting the bushes so that she had a
good view of the scene Mara saw the
troops, half a dozen in number, dash into
sight.</p>

<p>To her dismay the Wizard Scout went
coolly forward to meet them, crying as
they swept down upon him.</p>

<p>“Hold up there, boys! would ye ride
right over an old man?”</p>

</div>


<p>“Fire and furies!” cried the leader
startled by the sudden appearance of the
man, “whom have we here? Whoa, Ned!”</p>

<p>“Only me,” replied the strange scout,
meekly. “Don’t ride over me, Mister
Sojers, and I’ll get out of the way as soon
as I can.”</p>

<p>“Who are you? and where do you
come from, old man, at this hour?”</p>

<p>“My name is Moses, sir! am going to
my darter’s, Ann Mayhesters. P’raps
you know Ann Mayhesters?”</p>

<p>“Hang you and Ann Mayhesters. Get
out of my way, old graybeard, or I’ll
ride right over you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t, Mister Sojers; have respect
for these gray hairs. Whither do you
ride so fast?”</p>

<p>“Ride over the old fool,” exclaimed one
of the horsemen.</p>

<p>“Say, old man, have you seen any one
on your journey to-night?”</p>

<p>“Seen any one, my young friend, truly
I have not, barring one and I would
hardly think of naming her.”</p>

<p>“Then you have seen one&mdash;a woman,
too!” cried the other, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Boys, she is our game.”</p>

<p>“Ten to one!”</p>

<p>“Where did you see her, old covey?”</p>

<p>“Oh, way back here, heap of a ways.
She hid when I kem ’long, and I didn’t
let on thet I see’d her.”</p>

<p>“She’s the one. Old man, we are sent
out to capture that woman. She’s a spy.
Can you show us where you saw her?”</p>

<p>“She a spy,” grasped the disguised
scout.</p>

<p>“Can you guide us to her?” asked the
officer, growing impatient.</p>

<p>“Can I? O’ coorse I can. The way is
as plain as the road to Ann Mayhesters’.
You&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then lead us to her if you value your
life, old man.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes!” mumbled the other; “only
it’s a heap of a road, and I’m not very
fast. Can’t I jess get a lift ’hind one of
you fellers?”</p>

<p>“Let him get up behind you, Landaff.”</p>

<p>With what assistance the other could
lend, the scout climbed up on the horse’s
back behind the rider.</p>

<p>“Don’t go fast,” he muttered, “or
you’ll throw me off. Keep straight ahead
till I tell you to stop.”</p>

<p>Mara was an anxious spectator of this
scene, and as she saw the little cavalcade
ride away bearing in its midst the scout
she was at a loss to account for his singular
course.</p>

<p>She could not think that it was to work
her harm. What then could be his object?</p>

<p>The road followed by the horsemen led
toward the mountains.</p>

<p>They rode on for a mile or more before
any one spoke, when the leader reined
up.</p>

<p>“How much further, old man, must
we go?”</p>

<p>“I see’d her jess about thet turn. But
she were going up the valler.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall soon overtake her; that
is, if she was on foot.”</p>

<p>“She were.”</p>

<p>“Good; come on.”</p>

<p>After going half a mile further the old
man called upon them to stop.</p>

<p>They were now in the heart of a wild
country.</p>

<p>The mountains loomed up in the distance
ahead.</p>

<p>On either hand was a rough, broken<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
ravine or gulch running back to the base
of the heights.</p>

<p>“Hark! I thought mebbe I herd her
holler. But my old ears ain’t to be depended
on like they were once. Ann
Mayhesters, my&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shut up your gabble, old fool!” commanded
the leader. “I thought I heard
some one cry out.”</p>

<p>In the silence that followed a faint cry
was borne to their ears from the fastness
of the region to their right.</p>

<p>It was beyond dispute a woman’s voice.</p>

<p>“It is her!” exclaimed the old man,
excitedly. “She has fell among the
rocks.”</p>

<p>“It must be she,” declared the officer.
“But how in the name of Jackson can
we get our horses up the gully? We shall
have to leave them.”</p>

<p>“So I reckon,” affirmed the scout.
“And you’ll have to leave me, too.
Hark! there is her cry agin.”</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the fact.</p>

<p>“You remain here with the horses,
Landaff, while the rest of us go up and
capture her. We shan’t be gone long.”</p>

<p>Quickly suiting action to words they
dismounted and started up the ravine.</p>

<p>The cry was heard again.</p>

<p>The Wizard Scout calmly watched the
departure of the five men until they disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p>He was still sitting on the horse behind
the one called Landaff.</p>

<p>Suddenly the latter felt a vise-like grip
upon his mouth, and the next instant
both were struggling on the ground.</p>

<p>“Don’t move if you value your life!”
hissed the scout in his ear. “I am going
to bind you but will not harm you if you
are quiet.”</p>

<p>It was but a few minutes’ work to carry
out his design, and he not only bound
but gagged the man.</p>

<p>“I’ll risk you now,” he said.</p>

<p>The other rolled his eyes and glared
furiously upon him, but was powerless to
help himself.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll just do a little confisticating,”
declared Old Fatality, as he prepared
to take away a couple of the horses.
“As I don’t want you to tell any stories
on me I’ll take you along, colonel. Yes,
by goll, and I’ll take all of the horses.”</p>

<p>Seizing Landaff in his arms as if he had
been a child the scout placed him upon
the back of one of the horses.</p>

<p>He then mounted one of the others,
and prepared to lead the rest.</p>

<p>Glancing up the ravine to see that the
Confederates were nowhere in sight, he
started down the road.</p>

<p>Walking the animals until beyond the
hearing of his enemies the scout then increased
their speed.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he stopped in front
of the place where he had left Mara.</p>

<p>She was about to leave her hiding-place
feeling certain that he had deserted
her. Her joy at his return was very
great as may be well imagined.</p>

<p>Before she could speak the scout exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Quick! mount one of the horses and
foller me. I hev left the graycoats in the
lurch up yonder&mdash;all but this one and he’s
for company. Come on!”</p>

<p>Scarcely waiting for Mara to gain a
seat upon the nearest horse the Wizard
Scout rode ahead.</p>

<p>The captive Confederate was beside
him grimly biding the time when he
could give his vigilant foe the slip.</p>

<p>The loose horses were kept along for a
time when one by one Old Fatality let
them go, not caring to be bothered with
them longer than he could safely avoid.</p>

<p>Nothing was said by either of the party,
each being occupied with conflicting
emotions.</p>

<p>To Mara the scenes of the past few
days seemed like a horrible dream.</p>

<p>In the midst of her anxious thoughts
the Wizard Scout suddenly reined up his
foam-flecked horse. His long, gray locks
streaming in the night breeze, his
deep-set orbs of vision burning like coals
of fire, he presented a wild appearance.</p>

<p>“Hark!” he said, sharply, “I hear the
hoof-strokes of a body of horsemen coming
this way. They must be grays and
we are sure to meet them!”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE MEETING OF FRIENDS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mara uttered a low cry at the scout’s
startling announcement.</p>

<p>“Cannot we go some other way and
thus escape them?” she asked, tremulously.</p>

<p>“Not without turning back,” replied
the Wizard Scout, “and that would cost
us hours of valuable time without throwing
them off our track. No; I see no better
course for us than to keep on. Ha! I
have a plan.”</p>

<p>Landaff, whose countenance had
brightened at the sound of the approaching
horsemen, turned to his captor with
a look of surprise.</p>

<p>“I should like to know what all this
means, old man,” he exclaimed, speaking
for the first time.</p>

<p>“Hey,” said the scout, “ye see my darter
and I hev been turned outen house
and home by ’em cursed grays. We
ain’t got nowhar to lay an ear. So ye see
we kem over the mountins to go to my
t’other darter’s, Ann Mayhesters. Mebbe<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
ye know her. She’s a rebel. So’s my
darter, Mollie, here. Their ma was a
Southern woman. I am a Union man
twenty-four hours every day and not
afeerd o’ Stonewall Jackson an’ all his
army. Mebbe my mulishness got us inter
this difficulty. ’Tain’t fer myself I keer.
It’s the gal.”</p>

<p>“But ye’re trapped at last, old man,”
retorted the Confederate, smiling triumphantly.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure o’ thet.”</p>

<p>“But those troops coming beyond
no doubt belong to Johnston’s forces.
Hark! they will soon be here. You had
better free me, old man. It is for your
interest.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’m going to do.
But afore I set in I’m going to lay down
a bit a law. Ye see thet shooter, man;
it is loaded to kill. An’ the lead it carries
is fer you unless you do just as I tell you.
I don’t look like a man who eats his
words, do I? Wal, I’m goin’ to set you
free. Then I want you to ride forward
with us just as if you were doing it willingly.
If the party are a Northern squad,
I’ll make it all right with them. If they
are grays, as I expect, you are to tell
them that you are escorting the gal and I
to our relative’s in Macon, an’ that we
are true blue&mdash;I mean in this case gray.
Remember I shall watch your every
movement and if you dare to betray me
by word or sign I’ll shoot you at the moment.
My hand will be on this weapon
all of the time. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>The man winced but did not offer to
speak.</p>

<p>“To prove to you that I will do as I
say, I will tell you that I am Old Fatality,
the Wizard Scout!”</p>

<p>A groan from the other told that the
mention of that dreaded name was not
without its effect.</p>

<p>By this time the clatter of horses’ hoofs
was near at hand, and without further
delay the scout freed the captive.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget my warning!” he hissed
in the trembling wretch’s ear. “Come,
ride forward and do as I have told you to
the letter.”</p>

<p>Without daring to disobey, while hoping
that fortune would turn in his favor,
the Confederate rode ahead a little in advance
of his captor, whose eagle eyes
never for an instant left him.</p>

<p>Mara followed a little behind them.</p>

<p>By this time the oncoming cavalcade
was near at hand, and a minute later it
dashed into sight.</p>

<p>We need not say that they were an
anxious trio, though outwardly the Wizard
Scout appeared as calm as if expecting
to meet friends.</p>

<p>As the horsemen drew nearer, his countenance
lightened and then he said, half
aloud:</p>

<p>“It is he! we are saved.”</p>

<p>Mara heard the words and she supplemented
them with a cry of joy.</p>

<p>At the head of the approaching squad
she recognized the form of her lover,
Cavalry Curt!</p>

<p>He seemed scarcely less surprised than
they and his pleasure was as great.</p>

<p>“You have escaped in safety,” she said,
as he clasped Mara’s hand.</p>

<p>“Yes; though it has been a fearful
ordeal.”</p>

<p>“Well, have courage now, for the worst
of your journey is over I think. You are
going to your relatives to stop I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes; poor grandpa is no more. And
Harry! can you tell me ought of him?”</p>

<p>“Only that he was alive and well yesterday.
Please bear no unnecessary
alarm on his account. And as you shall
lose little in distance we will keep you
company ten miles or so on your
journey.”</p>

<p>Mara murmured her thanks.</p>

<p>“Whom have you here,” asked Curt of
the Wizard Scout, pointing to Landaff.</p>

<p>“One of our graycoat friends,” replied
the other. “And as he seems a little uneasy,
mebbe we had better secure him.”</p>

<p>Landaff had waited for an opportunity
to escape but his captor had been too
vigilant for him to make the venture.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the united parties
were moving on their journey.</p>

<p>Curt rode beside Mara to give her a succinct
account of his escape from Dalton
and the succeeding events, while she told
of all which had befallen her, and in an unguarded
moment dropped a word which
apprized him as to who his rescuer had
been.</p>

<p>“So you risked your life for me,” he
said, tenderly. “How can I pay you for
all you have done?”</p>

<p>“I feel amply paid to know that you
are safe.”</p>

<p>The naive confession sent a thrill of joy
to his heart.</p>

<p>But the time had come for them to part
again and he held her hand which trembled
in his while he saw the tear-drops
glisten in her eyes. He knew there were
several in his own.</p>

<p>“Have courage, dearest,” he whispered.
“The war will soon be over and then I
will come to you, loving and trusting.”</p>

<p>She tried to speak in vain, but when
his lips pressed hers they felt the thrill
of love’s sweet kiss.</p>

<p>“Till we meet again, darling, be of
good cheer.”</p>

<p>“Be careful of yourself, for my sake;
and remember me to Harry.”</p>

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
